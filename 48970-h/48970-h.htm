<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">A LETTER AND A TELEGRAM.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK RIBSAM, of whom I had considerable
to tell you in “The Young Moose
Hunters,” returned to his humble home in
Western Pennsylvania with his health fully
restored by his stirring experience in the
mountainous forests of Maine. He was naturally
strong and active, and one glance at his
bright eyes, his ruddy cheeks, and his alert
movements told his sister Nellie and the
beloved father and mother that the prescription
of the physician had worked like a charm.</p>

<p>Nick was now a sturdy youth, a bright
scholar and a general favorite with all who
knew him. His parents were not of the kind
that are demonstrative, but their hearts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
wrapped up in their worthy son, and they
were full of gratitude that he should come
back to them at the end of what, after all, was
only a brief absence, without a trace of the
weakness that caused them so much misgiving
when he went away.</p>

<p>They felt a strong friendship and affection,
too, for Herbert Watrous and his parents,
through whose kindness the trip down East
was brought about. There was no “discounting”
the fondness of the Watrouses for the
manly youth. Mr. Watrous, as has been
shown, possessed large means, and denied his
son nothing, his affection for Herbert leading
him astray in that respect. But he saw the
great good done his boy through his association
with Nick. You know that the most
forceful sermon ever preached is that of example.
It matters little what a person says, but
it is everything what he does. It is not the
profession, but the life which must be the test,
as it certainly will be before the final Judge of
all mankind.</p>

<p>Mr. Watrous and his wife welcomed Herbert
home, and their eyes sparkled at sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the immense stuffed moose forming a striking
trophy of the young man’s visit to Uncle Dick
Musgrove. He could not be blamed for feeling
proud over his prize, and for having a
number of large photographs struck off and
sent to his friends, but that which touched
the parents’ hearts was the change in Herbert
himself. He had always been fond of them,
but with that feeling was now mingled a
tender respect that had been wanting before.
He never forgot their wishes; he showed a
deeper interest in his studies; he abandoned
habits and associations which he knew his
parents disliked; he made a confidant of his
father as well as his mother, and consulted
with them and asked their counsel in whatever
important step he had in mind.</p>

<p>Now, what had wrought this change in Herbert
Watrous? Nick had done very little
“preaching” to him. True, whenever the
chance was inviting, he dropped a word or two
that clinched an important principle, and now
and then, when their long talks took a favorable
drift, he gave his views with a power and
point that could not be mistaken, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the daily life of Nick that did the blessed
work.</p>

<p>A family holding the social position of Mr.
Watrous in New York has no lack of privileges
for a son; but there was nothing that
gave Herbert the genuine pleasure that he
gained by a visit to Nick Ribsam, in his quiet
country home in Western Pennsylvania. The
pure air, the healthful food, the perfect cooking,
the cleanliness that was everywhere, the
cheerfulness, the mutual love and confidence,
the warm welcome from everyone&mdash;these
brought to him an enjoyment and satisfaction
far beyond what mere wealth can buy.</p>

<p>It was during the early autumn succeeding
the incidents told in “The Moose Hunters,”
that Herbert paid his second visit to Nick.
The latter met him at the railway station, but
the delight of welcoming his old friend to his
country home was sadly marred by the appearance
of Herbert. Beyond a doubt he was in a
bad way. He was nearly six feet tall, very
slim, with a flushed face, a dragging walk,
short breath, and, indeed, with every sign of
incipient consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know what you are thinking about,”
said he, with a wan smile, “but I don’t look
any worse than I feel.”</p>

<p>“You do look bad,” replied Nick, as he
drove homeward in their old-fashioned carriage.
“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know; the doctor says I am
growing too fast, have studied too hard, and
haven’t had enough exercise. You know I
meant to enter Yale this fall and have been
boning like the mischief. But I have given up
that and postponed college for a year at least,
and,” he added with a sigh, “perhaps forever.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk that way,” said Nick,
pained beyond expression; “you must stop
all study and live outdoors for a few weeks.
You have no bad habits, Herbert?”</p>

<p>“None at all, though I may be reaping
the penalty of my former foolishness; but I
haven’t touched tobacco or alcohol in any
form for six months.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason why you should not come
out all right in a short time,” added Nick, uttering
the wish rather than the belief he felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a letter in my pocket from my
father to your father; I know what is in it,
but I will let him tell you himself.”</p>

<p>Home being reached, the team put away,
and a kind welcome given to Herbert by Nellie
and her parents, all sat down to the meal
awaiting them. At its conclusion, Herbert
handed the letter he bore to Mr. Ribsam, who
curiously broke the seal.</p>

<p>When he saw it was written in English he
smiled and passed it to his son.</p>

<p>“I vill lets Nick read him, cause I don’t
English reads as vell as German as I don’t.”</p>

<p>Nick took the missive and read aloud, the
others listening attentively:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<span class="smcap">New York</span>, October 13, 18&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn">“<span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Ribsam</span>:</p>

<p>“My son Herbert has expressed the gratitude which
his mother and myself will ever feel toward your noble
son Nicholas, for the immeasurable good he has done my
boy by his precept and example. That influence will
follow him like a blessing through life, and you and
your good wife are to be congratulated on having such
a worthy child.</p>

<p>“I am about to ask a great favor of you. We are
alarmed for Herbert’s health. It is certainly singular
that last winter it was your son whose condition was
bad, while now it is my own who is in a condition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
causes us the gravest alarm. I have consulted the best
physicians in New York, who tell me that he is threatened
with consumption; that medicine will not cure
him, but, like your own son last year, he must give up
his indoors life at home and secure a radical change of
air and surroundings.</p>

<p>“I would arrange to have him spend a few weeks with
you, where I know he is welcome, but the medical men
tell me that he runs a risk so long as he is exposed to a
northern climate, with its sudden and violent changes.</p>

<p>“We have considered the question of a sea voyage,
and a winter in the Bermudas, the West Indies, or in
Southern France; but there are objections to all these,
the principal of which is our dislike to have him go out
of our own country, where he would have to meet a new
language, different kinds of people, and unfavorable
surroundings.</p>

<p>“The plan we have decided upon is to send him on a
tour through the southwestern section of our own country.
We have arranged for him to visit Texas, Arizona,
New Mexico, and Southern California, hoping that by
the return of spring he will be so fully restored to health
that he can come home as sound in body as your own
son.</p>

<p>“The favor I ask of you is that you will consent that
Nicholas shall accompany him. I am aware that this is
asking a great sacrifice of you, and I have hesitated a
long time before putting the request on paper. You
need your boy at home with you; it will cause you and
his mother and sisters great misgiving to let him go
away for five or six months, and no doubt involve considerable
pecuniary loss. Still, my solicitude for my
own child forces me to ask this great sacrifice at your
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“In doing so, there are several conditions upon which
I shall insist. The first is that under no circumstances
shall it cost you or your son a penny. My position in
railway matters enables me to secure, without trouble,
passes on the leading lines from your home over the
entire route and return. These passes are now in Herbert’s
possession. Other expenses will be involved, as
some of the travelling will have to be done in stage
coaches and on horseback, to say nothing of the cost of
living. All this is provided for. My son has letters to
bankers at various points <i>en route</i> which will secure him
ample funds. They will need no outfit until they reach
San Antonio, and start further westward. It is my
earnest wish that if Nicholas accompanies Herbert, doing
so as his friend, companion, and, in one sense, his escort,
I shall be permitted to make compensation therefor, as
properly due you for loss of his valuable services.</p>

<p>“If you will consent that your son shall go with him,
I advise that the start be made at once from your house.
If you feel that I am presuming too much on your kindness
do not hesitate to say so, and I will try to make
other arrangements.</p>

<p>“I am, my dear sir, very truly yours,</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">J. H. Watrous</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To quote a familiar expression, the reading
of this letter produced a sensation. Every eye
was fixed on Nick, as he sat in his chair with
the missive in his hand, and pronounced the
words in a clear voice.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the conversation
that followed, for it was a long one in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
all shared, but late that afternoon Nick harnessed
up the old roan again and drove to
the railway station with Herbert. Hastily
leaving the vehicle, they passed into the telegraph
office, where the city youth wrote out
a telegram addressed to his father, and it
ran thus:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">It is all fixed: Nick and I leave for Texas and the
southwest to-morrow. Good-by, and love to you and
mother.</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Herbert.</span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THROUGH TO TEXAS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">LET ME skip a great deal of what may be
called introduction, for of necessity it
bore a resemblance to that which has already
been told, and has little if any connection
with the main events of my story.</p>

<p>Mr. Watrous’ arrangements for the comfort
of the boys was perfect. The ride to St. Louis
in the famous Limited Express was the luxury
of railway travelling, and they landed in the
Mound City within twenty-four hours after
leaving Philadelphia, where Nick met his old
friend, Ned Osmun, who had given to him his
wonderful ride on his engine to Jersey City.
He wished them every pleasure on their long
journey, which he said caused him a touch of
envy, but he meant to even-up matters by
another fishing excursion in Western Pennsylvania,
with a call on Nick’s parents and
pretty Nellie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>They stayed overnight at the Lindell in St.
Louis, but were in such a hurry to reach their
destination that, without spending any time
in visiting the sights and interesting scenes,
they left the following morning over the Iron
Mountain Railway for Texarkana.</p>

<p>This ride, though long and at times tedious,
was enjoyed by both, for the scenes and incidents
gave a foretaste of what was coming.
A number of cattlemen were on the train, and
the boys struck up an acquaintance with
them. They found them pleasant and ready
to impart all the information that was asked
for.</p>

<p>There were long hours of riding through the
dismal pine woods of Missouri and Arkansas,
where, mile after mile, they saw only an occasional
settler’s cabin, with the half-dressed
children playing around the door. In several
cases, the openings between the logs were so
large that they could look through both the
front and rear of the structure and see the
trees on the other side.</p>

<p>They left the train at Malvern, and took the
narrow gauge railway to the celebrated Hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Springs, twenty-five miles distant, where they
stayed overnight. One of the interesting
facts learned here was the clever manner in
which “Diamond Jo,” who built and owns
the narrow gauge railway, outwitted the Arkansas
Legislature, which forbade a charge of
more than five cents a mile on every line in
the State between any two places. The capitalist
named had been charging and receiving
ten cents a mile, and he now flanked the law
by locating the western terminus of his line
within two or three feet of the boundary of
Hot Springs, and continued serenely to receive
his excessive rates as before.</p>

<p>They reached Texarkana Saturday evening,
and, since there was no travelling westward on
Sunday, that day was spent in the town, which
lies partly within Texas and partly within Arkansas,
and includes within its odd name a portion
of the appellation of each of the two States.</p>

<p>They attended church, which was capable of
accommodating fifty people by crowding, and
whose walls contained but a single placard,
which was a request for the attendants not to
spit on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The next stopping place was at Austin, the
capital of Texas. The weather was quite
warm, but the nights were cool and breezy,
and the glimpses of the snowy cotton fields
were a treat to the boys, who looked upon them
for the first time.</p>

<p>They spent one night and a portion of a day
in Austin, visiting the capitol and strolling
through the city, which contains many fine
buildings of white marble-like stone, peculiar
to the vicinity. In the capitol they saw several
fine paintings of the early heroes of Texas.
On the cenotaph (since destroyed by the burning
of the capitol), was the inscription to the
memory of the defenders of the Alamo, which
is one of the most striking tributes ever conceived
by man: “THERMOPYLÆ HAD ITS MESSENGER
OF DEFEAT: THE ALAMO HAD NONE.”</p>

<p>The railway line to San Antonio had recently
been finished, and they arrived in that quaint
old town as night was closing in. A bright
moon was shining in an unclouded sky, and,
after registering at the Menger House, facing
the Plaza, they strolled through the city and
enjoyed a view of the Alamo by moonlight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The brown adobe walls were softened in the
mild radiance, and, as Nick described the defence
made by the garrison of less than two
hundred men against four thousand Mexicans
under Santa Anna, it seemed to Herbert that
he was witnessing that tremendous fight,
which continued for eleven days, until only
a dozen grimy, panting, and exhausted defenders
were left. The terrible Colonel Bowie
was shot in his sick bed, and Davy Crockett
was among the handful that at last surrendered,
under the promise of honorable
treatment, but were treacherously massacred
by Santa Anna.</p>

<p>The winding Colorado was impressively
beautiful in the moonlight, and the adobe mission
houses, which were visited the next day,
were viewed with the interest that all tourists
feel when they first look upon them. Each
was over a century old. One, in a fine state of
preservation, was pointed out, where the Jesuit
fathers were besieged by the Comanche Indians
for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities noticed in San Antonio
were the Mexican dogs, without a hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on their bodies, and the other canines, known
as “tramps” or “nobody’s dogs,” who roam
over the country between the city and the Rio
Grande, picking up their food, as do their
biped brothers, and confessing to the ownership
of no one. That portion of San Antonio
called Mexico was squalid, and made up of
old residents, many of whom cannot speak a
word of English, while in other sections nearly
everyone understands English, Spanish, and
German.</p>

<p>The boys stayed several days in this city,
for they looked upon it as their real starting
point or entrance into the great southwest.
They had talked over the question while on
their way thither, and agreed upon the line to
be followed. Herbert had a letter of recommendation
to Mr. Lord, a banker, by which he
could secure all the funds needed, and who
showed a wish to help him in every way in his
power.</p>

<p>He invited the boys to visit him at his
house, where they spent an evening with the
gentleman, who, having been a resident in
Texas from a date several years before the Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
War, was able to give the very knowledge and
counsel they needed. He told them a fact that
they had not noticed. San Antonio itself is a
resort for invalids threatened with, or suffering
from, pulmonary weakness, who find the mild,
equable climate very helpful. He had known
of cases in which it had wrought a complete
cure.</p>

<p>“But I see,” he said with a smile, “that
that doesn’t suit your ideas; while there are
many sights here that you have not seen&mdash;such
as the Colorado Springs&mdash;yet you could
not content yourselves in our sleepy town for
more than a day or two longer. You can take
the stage from here to El Paso, but the ride is
tiresome, and, at this season of the year, dusty
and trying to a degree.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we should fancy that,” said
Nick, who refrained from giving a hint of the
plan they had formed.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are both good horsemen?”
was the inquiring remark of the banker.</p>

<p>They answered that they were fairly good
riders. Nick had learned to ride horses
almost as soon as he could walk, and Herbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had taken instructions at an academy in
New York for a couple of years past.</p>

<p>“Everybody rides a horse or burro in
Texas,” said Mr. Lord, “and the only caution
you need is to make sure you possess a clear
title to the animal you throw your leg over.
There are few people hanged in Texas for
murder, but plenty are strung up every year
for horse-stealing. You would be objects of
suspicion if you should take a walk out in the
country. My advice, then, is to buy three
excellent ponies, provide yourselves with a
good outfit, including a fine repeating Winchester
rifle and a revolver apiece, with plenty of
ammunition. You will need an extra animal
to carry your luggage. Then strike out for
New Mexico. You will have to ride a clean
five hundred miles before crossing the boundary,
but it is the right season of the year,
and the ride will do you good.”</p>

<p>“Do you advise us to go alone?” asked
Herbert.</p>

<p>“By no means; you must have companions
who are familiar with the country, and they
can be easily secured.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“There are hunters, miners, prospectors, and
adventurers in San Antonio all the time, who
have either just come from the wild regions
beyond or are about to set out for them. They
may be rough in their ways, but they are generally
honest and trustworthy, and there will
be no trouble in engaging them as companions.”</p>

<p>“You have laid out the plan Herbert and
I had fixed upon, but we felt doubts about
being able to carry it out. We have informed
ourselves, so far as we can, concerning the
country over which we wish to ride, and the
more we learned, the more we saw the need of
having men who were familiar with it. How
about the Indians?”</p>

<p>“Well, you are liable to meet them, but
I do not think there is much to be feared, as
I have heard no disquieting rumors lately,
though,” added the banker significantly,
“I was shot at myself, within the present
year, by a party of marauding Comanches,
within six miles of San Antonio. When you
get into New Mexico, you will be likely to find
matters more lively.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you help us in engaging the right
parties?”</p>

<p>“I think so; call around at my office to-morrow
afternoon, when I am quite sure I will
be able to put you on the track of the ones
whom you ought to meet.”</p>

<p>The lads assured their host that they would
be glad to do so, and, declining his kind invitation
to spend the night at his home, bade him
good-evening and started on their return to
the Menger House.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN SAN ANTONIO.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK and Herbert stopped on the Plaza
to inspect a bear, which a lank Texan
had fastened to a staple by a rope, and was
waiting thus late at night for a purchaser.
The moment the boys passed, the owner began
urging them to buy, offering the brute for fifteen
dollars, and dwelling with much eloquence
on the great bargain it was for anyone.</p>

<p>Our friends, however, had no use for any
animals of that species, and, taking care to
keep beyond reach of the beast, who showed a
desire for closer acquaintance, they sauntered
toward the hotel.</p>

<p>Just before reaching it, someone touched
Nick’s arm in such a timid manner that he
turned, wondering what it could mean.</p>

<p>A lad about twelve years of age, ragged and
the picture of distress, asked in a tremulous
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please, sir, you’re from the North, aint
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nick; “is your home
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the lad, swallowing a lump
in his throat, “and I would give the world, if
I had it, if I was back there again.”</p>

<p>“How is it you’re here?”</p>

<p>“Me and Dick Harrison run away from
home; we lived in Philadelphia, and we
haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Where is Dick?”</p>

<p>“He’s off yonder, on the other side of the
Plaza; he’s just dead broke up, and says he
won’t try nothin’ more, but is goin’ to lay
down and die.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe anyone has ever died of
starvation in San Antonio; can’t you get
work?”</p>

<p>“We have been trying for two weeks; we
got a job or two that fetched us a little to eat,
but we can’t do nothin’ more.”</p>

<p>“Take us over to where Dick is,” said Herbert,
whose heart was touched, “and let us
see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on,” said the boy, so cheerfully that
Nick and his friend were satisfied he was telling
the truth. On the way across the Plaza,
they questioned Fred Beekman, as he gave his
name, still further.</p>

<p>“What made you run away from home,
Fred?”</p>

<p>“Me and Dick started out to kill Injins and
grizzly bears.”</p>

<p>“How did you make out,” asked Herbert,
who recalled that it was not so long since he
had indulged in similar ambitious ideas.</p>

<p>“We haven’t killed any yet,” replied Fred,
in such a doleful voice that the others could
not help smiling.</p>

<p>“How did you get the money to come to
Texas?”</p>

<p>“Dick and me stole it from our folks; we
bought rifles and pistols, but when we got to
Texarkana we was took up and the guns took
away from us; we managed to sneak off, and
had enough money left to come to Santone;
here it give out, and we’ve had it hard since.”</p>

<p>“Had you pleasant homes?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>This question set Fred to crying. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fingers were in his eyes, and he stumbled
along for several paces before he could answer:</p>

<p>“Nobody ever had better homes, but we got
it into our heads that it would be nice to shoot
grizzly bears and Injins, and here we are. If
we only had enough money to keep us from
starvin’ we could walk home like reg’lar
tramps.”</p>

<p>“You are a good many miles from Philadelphia,”
said Nick. “If you could get there,
would you go straight home, or would you
start off on some other wild-goose chase like
this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could see father and mother and
my brother and two sisters, I would work and
go to school and do anything; I never knowed
how good a home I had till I run away, and
Dick feels the same way.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they reached the spot
where Dick had been left, but he was nowhere
in sight. Fred looked around in wonder, and
then became frightened.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s gone and drownded hisself,”
he said, in an awed whisper, “for he felt
’nough like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boys like him don’t drown themselves,”
replied Nick, who began to distrust the truthfulness
of the lad; “if you want us to give
you any help you must find Dick and bring
him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There he is!” broke in Fred, pointing to
a figure lurking among the shadows some
distance off, as if afraid to venture closer.
“Here, Dick, come here! you needn’t be
scart, they won’t hurt you!”</p>

<p>Seeing the lad approaching, Nick said:
“Now, Fred, I don’t want you to speak a
word till I get through with Dick.”</p>

<p>With considerable hesitation Dick ventured
nearer, and Nick immediately took him in
hand. After much questioning, he became
convinced that the story told by the two was
true. They were equally ragged and wretched
looking, and, despite their coarse language,
gave evidence of having belonged to good
families.</p>

<p>Nick and Herbert provided them with an excellent
supper. They were as ravenous as
wild animals, and left no doubt that they were
half famishing. Then, having made sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they had a place to sleep during the night,
Nick told them to call at the hotel in the
morning, and he would see whether he and
his friend could do anything for them.</p>

<p>During the interview, Nick managed to get
the addresses of their parents in Philadelphia,
without either suspecting his purpose. On
reaching the Menger, he at once telegraphed to
each father, asking whether a son whose name
he gave was missing. He hardly doubted
their story, but it was well that he took means
to make sure, before acting upon that belief.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, a reply came to
each message, saying that the boys had been
missing for six weeks, begging Nick to send
both home without delay, and pledging that
the expense would be paid by the senders of
the telegrams, or, if desired, funds would be
telegraphed. Nick notified the parents that
the boys would start northward in the morning,
and a statement of the money expended
would be forwarded by mail.</p>

<p>When Fred and Dick presented themselves
to Nick and Herbert, and were told that word
had been received from their relatives, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
would be delighted to receive them, they could
hardly believe it, but were finally satisfied that
there was no deception about it.</p>

<p>Herbert and Nick took the boys to a clothing
establishment, where they were provided
with comfortable outfits, a through ticket was
furnished to each, enough money given to pay
their expenses, and then, with a few words of
counsel, they were despatched homeward, the
happiest boys in the big State of Texas.</p>

<p>Then Nick inclosed the memoranda to the
proper parties, and dismissed the subject from
his mind, for weightier matters required attention.</p>

<p>Upon calling at the banker’s office in the
afternoon, they were surprised to find he had
not only selected the two men that were to
bear them company, but they were present, by
appointment with Mr. Lord, who knew at
what time the youths would arrive.</p>

<p>The individuals were typical cowboys, with
their broad-brimmed sombreros and rattlesnake
bands, their heavy shirts, trousers
tucked in the tops of their boots, immense
spurs, long wavy hair, handkerchiefs knotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
about their necks, bright eyes and not unhandsome
countenances.</p>

<p>Arden Strubell, the elder, was about thirty-five
years of age and wore a long moustache
and goatee, which, like his hair and eyes, were
of a dark auburn. Baker Lattin, his companion,
was a few years younger, with lighter
hair, a faint moustache, no goatee, was wide
across the temples, and his eyes were light
blue or gray, but his appearance was as alert
and intelligent as the other’s.</p>

<p>These men were old friends of banker Lord,
who had engaged with them upon several
hunting excursions. It had fallen within his
power to do for them a number of monetary
favors, and they were the men who were ready
to show their gratitude in any way he desired.</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin intended to start in the
course of a day or two for a ranch in New
Mexico. They expected to travel the entire
distance on horseback, accompanied by a
single pack animal. Both once belonged to
the mounted rangers of Texas, and had probably
ridden over as much of that vast area as
any other man within its limits, from No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Man’s Land on the north, through the Pan
Handle and across the Llano Estacado to the
Rio Grande and the Pecos on the south and
west.</p>

<p>Strubell had been in several brushes with
the terrible Geronimo and his dusky desperadoes,
but he did not expect to reach the
section where there was danger of collision
with them, their stamping ground being
further to the west.</p>

<p>Banker Lord had been offered a ranch over
the line in New Mexico, at such reasonable
figures that he was much inclined to buy it,
but, with his usual caution, he desired to
know of a certainty its value before investing
the money. Strubell and Lattin had been
employed, therefore, to make a thorough examination
and to report on the same to him.</p>

<p>This happened most opportunely for Nick
and Herbert, who thus were furnished with
the very best company on their long and
dangerous ride through Western Texas, while
the ranchmen were ordered to go with them,
if necessary, beyond into Arizona and Southern
California.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STARTLING INTERRUPTION.</p>


<p class="drop-cap03">IT did not take the boys long to become
acquainted with Strubell and Lattin. The
former showed by his conversation that he
possessed a fair education, though Lattin was
barely able to write his name. They were
frank, outspoken, courageous, ready of resource,
familiar with all the dangers they
were likely to meet on the long ride toward
the northwest, and the finest horsemen the
boys had ever seen.</p>

<p>Through the help of the Texans, Nick and
Herbert secured three excellent animals, two
of them possessing great speed and endurance,
while the third was the equal of the best
burro or mule for carrying a heavy burden.
The Winchesters were the best, too, of their
kind, the men being similarly armed. Nick
and Herbert took care to provide themselves
with an excellent field-glass apiece, for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was more likely than that they would find
abundant call for their use. The rest of the
supplies were bought on the advice of the
cowboys.</p>

<p>They passed near a number of towns and
settlements during the first week, in one of
which they generally stayed overnight. So
long as they were able to secure the comforts
of ordinary travel through a settled section,
they would have been foolish to decline it.</p>

<p>It had been so long since the boys had
ridden far on horseback, that they were
stiffened for the first few days, so that, when
they dismounted, they were hardly able to
walk. This, however, soon wore off until
they were able to stand a ride of forty or fifty
miles without any ill effects.</p>

<p>No physician could have watched a patient
with greater care than Nick watched Herbert.
He tried to keep it from the knowledge of his
friend, and thought he succeeded, though
Herbert told him afterward that he knew all
the time what he was doing.</p>

<p>The elder youth felt bad when they reached
St. Louis, and was still worse on their arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in San Antonio. The long ride in the cars
made him feverish, and he had little appetite,
but the new scenes and surroundings, the
cheerful company of Nick, and his own
ambition did wonders in the way of keeping
him up.</p>

<p>He showed an improvement within twenty-four
hours after arriving in the City of the
Alamo, and this continued steadily, until the
second day out, when the beautiful weather,
that they had been having for weeks, was
broken by a norther which, however, was not
severe, though it brought so much rain and dismal
weather that they were compelled to lie by
at one of the straggling frontier towns for
several days.</p>

<p>They rode through the hills and highlands
between Fredericksburg and Fort Clark, fording
a tributary of the Llano River, and pushing
almost due northwest toward New Mexico,
whose southeast corner they were aiming to
strike at the point of intersection between
the twenty-sixth meridian and thirty-second
parallel.</p>

<p>The country now began to assume a wilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
appearance. The weather was like a dream,
and Nick could well understand how it is that
more than twenty thousand people in Texas
never sleep under a roof from one year’s end to
another. He could appreciate, too, the reason
why the immigrant, no matter how homesick,
who braves it out for six months, never leaves
Texas unless for a brief visit to his northern
home, returning to die in the Lone Star State,
which has become the land of his adoption.</p>

<p>The appearance showed the country, or
rather that portion of it, to contain a great
many more people than the boys supposed
before entering Texas. The settlements were
generally miserable collections of shanties,
with the inevitable gambling and drinking
saloon and the quota of “bad men,” on the
lookout for tenderfeet, or those of their own
class that were ready to mingle in a row off-hand.
Everyone rode on horseback, and carried
his revolver and rifle, the latter generally
a Winchester of the repeating pattern.</p>

<p>The cattlemen were numerous, some of them
nearly always in sight among the hills, or on
the broad, rolling prairie. Occasionally an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was met, but he was far from being the
romantic individual that boys generally have
in mind, when reading about the noble red
man. He was untidy and sullen looking,
with an appetite for whiskey that was never
sated, and the odor of rank tobacco around
him.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the departure from
San Antonio that the youths noticed a marked
change in things. The country became more
broken, the settlements disappeared, and during
the middle of the afternoon, when Herbert
swept the horizon with his field glass, he made
known, with an expression of surprise, that
there was not a living person, so far as he
knew, in sight.</p>

<p>“We’ve put a good piece of country behind
us,” said Strubell, “and if nothing goes
wrong, we ought to strike New Mexico in the
course of the next ten days.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“I fancied we would make it in less time
than that.”</p>

<p>“So we mought,” remarked Lattin, “if
there was any call to hurry; but, as I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
this business, we aint runnin’ the pony
express for Santa Fé or Rincon.”</p>

<p>That night their camp was in a section
which charmed the boys, for there was an air
of loneliness, and the danger that seemed to
be brooding over the vicinity was of a kind
not yet encountered since entering Texas.</p>

<p>In some respects, the camp reminded them
of their moose hunt in Maine, though the contrast
in the season was marked. There were
the hills, rising almost to the dignity of mountains,
the bowlders and rocks, the stream of
water, not more than a few inches in width
and depth, and the beautiful blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>The weather was cooler than it had been,
and the hunters shook their heads, and hinted
about a norther that was liable to break over
them before many hours. There were no signs
of Indians, and had there been, the aborigines
would have been held in no greater dread than
those of their own race. The party were so
far westward that the arm of the law was
weak, and everyone must depend on his own
vigilance and alertness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When the wood, which was not over abundant
in those parts, was collected for the fire
by which they intended to cook the meat
obtained from a maverick earlier in the day,
the horses were turned loose, and the four
friends gathered around the blaze, which was
kindled in an open space, where the light was
visible for a long way in nearly every direction.
Around this they sat, and, while the
men smoked their pipes, they recalled many a
thrilling encounter with the red men in the
Pan Handle, in Arizona, and in New Mexico.
Strubell and Lattin were equally interested in
the story which Nick told of their hunt for
the king of moose in Maine. That species of
game was unfamiliar to them, and when they
learned of the gallant style in which Herbert
brought down the big fellow at the moment
he was charging upon his companion, they
looked upon the tall youth with something
like wonder and admiration. They had no
idea of having such a hero “in their midst.”</p>

<p>Since it was necessary that everyone should
bear a hand in guarding against the perils
on which they were entering, the hunters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
arranged that the youths should regularly
take part in standing watch each night.
Their method made it easy and safe for all,
since the watches were four in number, each
about two hours long. Everyone was able to
keep awake for that length of time, even while
sitting on the ground, and the turns alternated,
so as to equalize the task all round.
Had the watches been longer, the youths, as
was the case while down East, would have
been likely to slumber on their posts.</p>

<p>Arden Strubell was stretched out on the
further side of the fire, flat on his back, his
head resting on a stone, which was softened
somewhat by his hands that were clasped between
it and the back of his head, with the
elbows projecting like wings from each side.
One leg was partly drawn up, with the other
crossed over it, his position being the picture
of indolence and ease. The pipe, whose stem
was in the corner of his mouth, was only gently
puffed at long intervals, for it was Arden’s
turn to sleep until eleven o’clock. He was,
therefore, taking no share in the conversation
which went on in such gentle, murmuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
tones that it tended more to drowsiness than
wakefulness on his part.</p>

<p>Matters were in this form, and the night was
progressing, when Lattin, who was sitting
directly opposite his friend, raised his hand
for silence, and said in a frightened whisper:</p>

<p>“Arden, don’t move or you’re a dead
man!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” was the quiet reply from the
Texan, who did not stir a muscle, “but what
can I do? I’m a dead man anyway.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">A TEST OF ONE’S NERVES.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK RIBSAM and Herbert Watrous
could hardly believe their own senses,
and for a second or two looked at each other
and at the cowboys, to make sure they had
heard aright.</p>

<p>The youths were lolling near each other,
Nick leaning on his elbow and looking in the
broad face of Lattin, who just then was telling
of a scrimmage in which he had had
the closest call of his life while hunting Geronimo,
while Herbert sat more erect.</p>

<p>Strubell, as has been told, was lying on his
back on the other side of the camp fire, his
hands clasped behind his head, and resting on
his stone pillow. His sombrero lay on his
forehead, in such a way that a part of the rim
shaded his eyes, whose view of the outer world
was obtained by gazing down along the front
of his face and chin. He could see his slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
heaving breast, the cartridge belt, and the one
leg crossed over the other and partly crooked
at the knee. Off to the left was the glowing
camp fire, and, by turning his eyes without
moving his head, he could trace a part of the
figure of Lattin, who was discoursing for the
entertainment of his young friends.</p>

<p>This was the shape of matters, when the
younger cowboy abruptly checked his narrative,
and, looking across the fire at his companion,
warned him not to move on the penalty
of instant death, to which the other, without
stirring a muscle or giving any evidence of
alarm, calmly replied that he was aware of his
situation, which was so hopeless that he considered
himself the same as dead already.</p>

<p>“Don’t move,” added Lattin in a whisper
to the boys, “or you will scare it; keep on
talking the same as before, and maybe it will
let him alone.”</p>

<p>“What are you referring to?” asked the
perplexed Nick.</p>

<p>“There’s a tarantula lying on Arden’s
breast; don’t you see it?”</p>

<p>The hideous thing was sitting on the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the cowboy, directly over his heart. Where
it had come from no one could say, but probably
the warmth of the fire or that of the body
of the Texan had drawn it to the spot, and it
was now making an exploration, on its own
account, ready to inflict its deadly bite on the
least provocation.</p>

<p>Strubell was half asleep, when, looking
along the front of his body, he saw the outlines
of the spider in the yellow light of the
camp fire. It caused a slight tickling sensation,
as it slowly felt its way forward. He
knew its nature the instant he caught sight of
it, and he observed that it was of unusual
size and fierceness. He had seen a comrade
die from the bite of a tarantula, which is held
in greater dread than the famous rattlers of
Texas, for it gives no warning of its intentions,
which most frequently come in the form of a
nipping bite whose effects are not only fatal
but frightfully rapid.</p>

<p>Arden might have slowly unclasped his
hands and given the thing a quick flirt, but
the chances were a thousand to one that, if he
did so, it would bite his finger. If let alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it might change its purpose and crawl off into
the darkness. It was not likely to injure him
so long as it stayed on the front of his shirt,
for it was hard for it to bite through that.
It preferred the naked surface of the body in
order to do its worst.</p>

<p>It could not very well bite the hands, since
they remained clasped behind the Texan’s
head. The nearest favorable points were the
neck, where the shirt was open, and the face.
If the spider crept upward, it was evident that
it was making for one or the other, and there
seemed no way of checking it, for the first
move on the part of any one of the friends
would rouse its anger, and cause it to bite the
man on whose body it was resting. All that
could be done was to do nothing, and pray to
Heaven to save the poor fellow from impending
death.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t show by anything we do,”
said Lattin, “that we are excited. A quick
move&mdash;a loud call, or any unusual motion may
lead it to use its teeth. It’s the biggest and
ugliest tarantula that I ever laid eyes on, and
if it gives Arden one nip, he’s a goner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it is terrible to sit here and see him
die,” said Nick, who was so nervous he found
it hard to remain still, while Herbert trembled
as if with a chill.</p>

<p>“It’s all we can do,” replied the Texan,
who nevertheless kept a sharp eye on the
thing, as if he was meditating some desperate
resort to save his comrade’s life. “We will
talk on, as though nothing has took place out
of the usual run, and while we’re at it we’ll
keep an eye on the critter.”</p>

<p>“What good will it do to keep an eye on
it,” was the sensible question of Nick, “if we
do nothing?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me and don’t either of you
stir. You know that we’re on our way to
look after a ranch that Mr. Lord thinks of
buying in New Mexico?”</p>

<p>He paused and gazed at the boys, as if in
doubt whether they understood the matter.
They nodded their heads and he continued:</p>

<p>“George Jennings owns the ranch and
wants to move east. Last year he had
another in Arizona. It was too small to suit
him, and he came over this way, and now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as I said, wants to get out of the bus’ness
altogether. You know, I s’pose, that they
have warm weather in Arizona at certain times
in the year?”</p>

<p>Once more the cowboy checked himself, as
if he desired a reply. He seemed to be looking
at the boys, but in reality was watching
the tarantula, which was motionless on the
breast of Strubell, as if he, too, was debating
what was best to do.</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any part of the country
where they do not have pretty hot weather in
the course of the year,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“But Arizona lays over ’em all,” said
Lattin, as if proud of the fact; “I’ve seen it
day after day there, and night, too, when the
thermometer doesn’t get below a hundred.
Wal, it was on one of them blazing afternoons,
that Jennings stretched out on the floor in his
low front room to take a nap. His wife had
gone to San Pedro a couple of days before,
under the escort of the two ranchmen hired by
him, and he was looking for ’em back every
hour.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it came about that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
father was left with his little gal Mabel,
which was only six years old. Jennings loved
that gal more than the apple of his eye,
and would give his life any time to keep her
from harm. I b’lieve you’ve a little sister,
Nick, that you think a good deal of?”</p>

<p>“I have, God bless her!” replied Nick, as
the moisture crept in his eyes; “there is
nothing I would not do to save her from
suffering and pain.”</p>

<p>Again, Lattin seemed to be looking at the
countenance of the honest youth, but in reality
his eyes were on the tarantula, and his right
hand was moving slowly down his side toward
his revolver in the belt at his waist.</p>

<p>“That bein’ so, you can understand how
much Jennings thought of his little gal Mabel.
Wal, he was in the middle of a nap, when he
jumped to his feet as if he had seen a rattler
crawling over the floor toward him. The
reason why he jumped up so quick was ’cause
he heard his little gal scream. He went out
the door as if shot from the mouth of a
cannon.</p>

<p>“The sight that met the ranchman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
enough to set any father wild. Two of Geronimo’s
Apaches, each on a pony, was galloping
off on a dead run. One of them held Mabel
in his arms, and the little gal, at sight of her
father, reached out her arms and called to
him to come and take her away from the bad
Injun. Don’t you think that was enough to
turn a father’s brain?”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt of that,” replied
Nick, shuddering at the mental picture of his
sister Nellie in such an awful situation.</p>

<p>During the momentary pause, Lattin placed
his hand on the butt of his revolver. The tarantula
had not stirred more than an inch since
he was seen, but that was in the direction of
the Texan’s face, and his peril was becoming
more imminent than before.</p>

<p>“Be careful, boys,” said Strubell in his
ordinary tones, “the creature is getting nervous.
He is now looking at me, and is coming
a little closer to my face. Don’t try to brush
or knock him off: maybe he’ll hunt for some
other pasture, but the chances are against it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Ard,” replied Lattin with assumed
cheerfulness; “we see your fix and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
prayin’ for you. As I was sayin’, the sight
that met Jennings’ eyes, when he jumped out
of his door, was enough to set any man frantic.
He was back into the house again, and out
once more like a flash. He had his Winchester
with him this time, and brought it to his
shoulder, but the Apache that had his little
gal was on the watch and held her up in front,
so that the father couldn’t fire without killing
his own child. So Jennings just give one
groan and staggered back into the house and
almost fell on to the floor.</p>

<p>“The poor fellow was in a bad fix. The
nearest fort was a hundred miles off, and it
was almost as far to San Pedro. The two
Apaches had rode to the ranch on one pony,
but, when they went away, the one that didn’t
have the little gal was on the back of Jennings’
horse, and, since his wife and escort was
absent, there wasn’t a single critter on the
place.</p>

<p>“The first Apache had got so far off that
he was beyond rifle-shot before Jennings was
outdoors. He come out a few minutes later,
and, shading his eyes, looked off across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dusty plain, where his child had disappeared.
He thought the horses which he seen were
growing plainer. They were coming toward
him, and he didn’t know what it meant.</p>

<p>“For a while he didn’t stir, but kept looking
closely. Bimeby, he seen there was but one
horseman and he was Sam Ruggles, one of them
that had acted as the escort of Mrs. Jennings
when she went away. He was mounted on his
own horse, and leading that of Mrs. Jennings,
who he said would start home the next day.</p>

<p>“‘The country is so open,’ said Sam, ‘that
she thought I had better start at once, so as to
give you what help I could with the cattle&mdash;what’s
the matter, George?’ he asked, observing
the white face of his friend.</p>

<p>“‘Where did you get my horse?’ asked
Jennings, striving hard to control himself.</p>

<p>“‘Up near the ford,’ said Sam; ‘just as I
stopped to let my pony drink, someone fired
at me from the bush, and I dropped out the
saddle to the ground. I wasn’t hurt a bit; it
was a dodge of mine to trick the redskin. The
next instant, there was a whoop, and an
Apache galloped out of the bush toward me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sure of another scalp. Wal,’ added Sam, with
a grin, ‘an Apache can mistake, the same as
other folks, and I needn’t give you the partic’lars.
Your horse seemed to think he was
at liberty to travel home, and he went so fast
that I didn’t overhaul him till about a mile
out. I was worried thinkin’ something had
happened, and was glad enough to see that
everything was right.’ Now that was a big
mistake of Sam, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Nick and Herbert turned toward the speaker,
as both answered his odd question, and observed
that he now held his revolver in hand.</p>

<p>“Boys,” called poor Strubell, “the tarantula
is creeping toward my face; I guess he means
to bite; don’t stir, and if he gets much closer
I’ll make a sweep at him.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO GOOD SHOTS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">“WAL, then, Jennings tells Sam everything
that had took place. It was
wonderful the control the ranchman showed
over himself. His face was as white as death,
but he didn’t tremble, and talked as if he was
speaking about the cattle. Sam thought that
the Apache, having the extra load of the child
and dead warrior, would not be able to travel
fast, and there was a chance of fetching him
off his pony, but Jennings feared there was a
party of the varmints near by, and that he

would jine them.</p>

<p>“Howsumever, you may be sure they didn’t
lose any time talking, but jumping into their
saddles, was off across the plain like a couple
of whirlwinds. The trail showed that the
Apache, with the gal and dead warrior, had
kept close to the bushes that grew along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
stream, which was not very broad, and runs
into the Gila.</p>

<p>“A mile from the ford the two were surprised
to come upon the body of the Apache
that had been tumbled from the horse by
Sam’s Winchester. The other must have got
tired of carrying him, or was afraid his load
would get him into trouble.</p>

<p>“‘At any rate,’ said the father, ‘Mabel is
alive, though there’s no sayin’ how long she
will stay so.’</p>

<p>“Just then both catched sight of the very
Apache they was after. He was coming from
the bush on a swift gallop, and still holding
the crying child in front of him.</p>

<p>“Now, that Apache showed less cunning
than is generally showed by his people, for,
by thus hanging back, he gave the pursuers
the very chance they wanted to come up with
him. Even then he had so little fear that
Jennings and Sam believed there was a party
near at hand, though, as it turned out, it
wasn’t so.</p>

<p>“As he come out of the bush, he struck
across the open plain, with his pony on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sharp gallop, while little Mabel, seeing her
father, stretched out her arms agin toward him
and begged him to take her home.</p>

<p>“‘Leave him to me,” said Jennings, bringing
his Winchester to his shoulder. The redskin
raised the child again, but he was just a
second too late, for he rolled off his horse with
a hole bored through his skull, as dead as
dead could be.</p>

<p>“Mabel was bruised by her fall, but the
Apache was killed so quick that he hadn’t a
chance to put her out of the way, as he would
have done had he knowed what was comin’.
She was soon in her father’s arms, and all
come out right as it does in the stories.”</p>

<p>Despite the interest in the incidents related
by the Texan, the eyes of all three were fixed
on the dreaded tarantula, which had been comparatively
motionless for some minutes. It
now began creeping toward the face of Strubell,
who said in the same unwavering voice:</p>

<p>“He’s coming this time sure! He means to
bite, boys, and it’s all up with me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that instant, the oppressive stillness was
broken by the sharp report of Lattin’s revolver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which he had extracted from his belt a
few seconds before. He levelled and fired the
weapon with such marvellous quickness that
his friends hardly caught the movement.</p>

<p>But the aim was perfect. The tarantula that
was straddling across the chest of the prostrate
Texan, surcharged with virus and about
to inflict its fatal bite, vanished as though it
had never been. There was a faint whiz, and
it was gone into nothingness.</p>

<p>Arden Strubell did not stir, but remained
with his hands clasped behind his head and
every muscle motionless. Then, as his comrade
pronounced his name, his elbows fell and
the head partly rolled to one side.</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed Lattin, springing
up, “that’s the first time I ever seen Ard faint
away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that he did!” said Nick,
as he and Herbert also hurried to his relief.</p>

<p>They were hardly at his side and stooping
over him, when he opened his eyes with a wan
smile, and said faintly:</p>

<p>“It seems to have been a little too much for
me, boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>But he quickly rallied and assumed the sitting
position.</p>

<p>“I had just made up my mind to give the
spider a flirt with my hat,” he said, “but the
tarantula is so quick, I knew it would get in
its work before I could brush it off. If I had
struck at it with my hat when I first saw it
there would have been an even chance, but I
felt as though my arms were made of iron, and
I was like a man with the nightmare, who cannot
force his limbs to move. That was a good
shot of yours, Baker.”</p>

<p>“I’m rather proud of it,” replied Lattin,
settling back on his blanket, “and I thought
it must come to that from the first, but I was
so afraid of missing, that I put it off to the
last second. If I had failed, the report would
have started it into bitin’ you before I could
give it a second shot.”</p>

<p>“I wonder whether there are any more of
them around,” said Herbert, glancing furtively
about.</p>

<p>“That’s what has troubled me,” added
Nick.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any more of them will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
bother us,” remarked Strubell, quick to
recover from his fright; “we must expect
these little annoyances in this part of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Lattin, “when you find
such a fine climate as we have, and everything
else just right to make you the happiest chap
in the United States, which means the happiest
in the world, you oughter be willing to pay
for it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nick, who, now that the
oppressive burden was lifted, could smile at
the conceits of his friends, “when we come to
add the sum total, it will be found pretty much
the same the world over. It seems to me,
after the fright we have all had, that none of
us will be able to sleep.”</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked Strubell. Nick
looked at his watch, and replied that it was
near eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>The Texan gathered the folds of his blanket
around him, turned on his side, and within
five minutes was asleep. The youths were
amazed, but, as Lattin remarked, it was all
easy enough when you became used to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the place of Herbert to watch over the
camp from eleven until one o’clock, at which
hour Nick would take his turn, Lattin and
Strubell following in turn. The former willingly
kept company with the boys while they
discussed the startling occurrence early in the
evening. By and by, however, the Texan became
drowsy, and, bidding his young friends
good-night, he too gathered his thick blanket
about his muscular form, and joined his comrade
in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>When Herbert took out his handsome watch
to wind it, he leaned forward, so that the
light from the fire fell upon its face. It happened
that both hands were exactly together
at the figure twelve, so that it was midnight
and his duty was half over.</p>

<p>He looked round at the impressive scene.
The fire was burning cheerily, though with the
help of their thick, serviceable blankets the
warmth was not needed. The horses were
lying down, or cropping the grass, which was
not very abundant in the immediate vicinity,
and were too far off in the gloom to be seen.
Each of his friends was so swathed that he resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a log of wood when viewed from a
short distance. The feet of all were turned
toward the blaze, that being the general rule
when sleeping in camp. The saddles, rifles, and
extra luggage were loosely piled at one side,
and Herbert, who was always inclined to be
pressed down by his responsibility at such a
time, could not help reflecting how completely
a party of Indians or outlaws could place the
hunters at their mercy by a sudden dash from
the gloom.</p>

<p>But that kind of danger was not thought
of by either of the Texans, who were not
riding though this section for the first
time.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes later that Herbert
heard one of the horses emit a slight whinny,
as if something had disturbed him. The youth
peered in the direction whence it came, but
there was no moon and he discerned nothing.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is,” he said, pressing his
Winchester to make sure it was actually within
his grasp; “it may be another tarantula, a rattlesnake,
a bear, or some other wild animal or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wild person trying to steal into camp without
alarming us.”</p>

<p>One of the other ponies snuffed the air, the
noise being as distinct in the stillness as was
the sound of his watch when he wound it.</p>

<p>Herbert would not have been blamed had he
awakened Strubell or Lattin, but he decided
to wait before doing so. There was barely
a possibility of peril from Indians or white
men, and he considered himself able to meet
any other kind.</p>

<p>The air, that had been oppressively still,
was stirred by a breath which brought to him
a peculiar sound. It lasted only a moment,
and resembled the faint tapping of myriads of
hammers on the earth&mdash;so numerous indeed
that he suspected its meaning.</p>

<p>Applying his ear to the ground, he caught
it with greater distinctness. It was as he supposed:
an immense number of cattle were
galloping over the plain, beyond the hills.
They might be on their way to water or had
been startled by some trivial cause, which often
stampedes a drove that numbers thousands.</p>

<p>“Now if I find they are coming this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>”
thought the youth, “I will wake Strubell.
They wouldn’t be likely to enter the hills and
run over this fire, but they might make trouble
for our ponies.”</p>

<p>At intervals of a few minutes he pressed
his ear to the earth as before, and listened
closely. The second time he did so he was
certain the peculiar sounds were more distinct;
but, waiting a brief while, he tried
it again, and concluded they were neither
louder nor fainter.</p>

<p>“They can’t be standing still,” was his logical
conclusion, “and must soon come nearer
or go further off.”</p>

<p>Only a few minutes were required to settle
the question: the cattle were receding, and
doing so with such rapidity, that, much sooner
than would have been suspected, the sounds
had died out altogether.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN INTRUDER IN CAMP.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE minutes pass slowly at such times,
and, though Herbert’s duty lasted only
two hours, they seemed double the length of
that period during the day, or when his companions
were awake.</p>

<p>The listening ear caught no further sounds
of the multitudinous feet, and he dismissed
the matter from his mind. The still air now
and then was moved by what seemed a slight
breeze, or eddy of wind, but it was barely sufficient
to stir the blaze. Once he heard the
report of a gun, startlingly distinct, though he
knew it might have been fired fully a mile
away.</p>

<p>“We are not the only people in this part of
the world,” he mused, giving expression to his
reveries; “and that shot may have ended the
life of some person.”</p>

<p>It was a disturbing thought, and, as if to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
drive off the oppressiveness that was weighing
him down, he rose to his feet and threw more
sticks on the flames. His watch showed that
it was only half-past twelve. He held the
time-piece to his ear, suspecting that it had
stopped running; but the familiar ticking was
audible, and a glance at the tiny second-hand
showed that it was really moving, though it
never seemed to creep so tardily around the
little circle.</p>

<p>Then he watched the indicator as it marked
its course, and resorted to the many artifices
that occur to those who find time dragging
wearily on their hands. No hour ever seemed
longer than was required for the watch to
show that a fourth of that time had passed
forever.</p>

<p>“But it will be worse for Nick,” he concluded;
“I think his task more wearisome
than mine. We have all to take our share,
however, as I suppose everyone must in the
good and bad of life.”</p>

<p>Herbert waited till the full time was up,
and several minutes over, when he stepped to
where Nick was lying, and gently shook his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shoulder. He awoke readily, prepared to act
his part as sentinel for the next two hours.</p>

<p>The elder told his friend what had occurred,
adding that he discovered nothing else to disturb
him. Then bidding him good-night, he
wrapped himself in his own blanket and lay
down with his feet toward the fire, falling
asleep almost as quickly as had the cowboys
before him.</p>

<p>Nick examined his rifle and saw it was
ready for instant service, as was his pistol,
with which he had practised until quite expert
in its use. He sat down just beyond the
circle of illumination thrown out by the blaze,
for, somehow or other, it always seemed to
him that such a course was not only safer, but
that he could maintain more effective watch
by doing so. He was able to see every one of
his friends, while a prowler was not likely to
observe him, unless his approach to camp was
such as to place the guardsman between him
and the blaze. In that event, he was quite
sure to notice his outlines against the fire.</p>

<p>That this was a wise proceeding was proven
by what followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been on duty for a half hour or
more when he was disturbed by the same
cause that startled Herbert. One of the
horses uttered a slight neigh, giving no other
evidence of alarm, if that was the meaning of
the sound.</p>

<p>At this moment Nick was well back, on the
opposite of the camp from the animals. He
was therefore confident that if anything
threatened them, he himself was invisible to
whatever it might be.</p>

<p>After listening a few minutes, he decided to
investigate for himself. This he did, not by
proceeding in a direct line, as he could have
done, but by making a circle which took him
beyond the light of the fire until nigh enough
to observe the animals.</p>

<p>They were on the ground, as though they
had cropped their fill, and now enjoyed rest
more than food. They appeared to be reposing
quietly, and he concluded that the slight
noise which he had noticed signified nothing.
Horses and other domestic animals often start
in their sleep, as though disturbed by
dreams, the same as do we, and that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Nick heard may have been evidence of the
fact.</p>

<p>Still, it is also a truth that men, when in
situations of peril, frequently find it safer to
rely more on the acuteness of their horse than
upon their own vigilance. The animal seems
to have his senses sharpened to the finest
point, for his master’s good.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s nothing wrong,” said Nick
to himself, after inspecting the ponies; “but
it is best to act as though danger always
threatens. That’s what Strubell and Lattin
say, and everyone must see its logic.”</p>

<p>The fire was now burning so low that he
gathered up a lot of wood and threw it on the
flames. While thus employed, his gun lay on
the ground near the feet of Herbert. The
thought that, if any hostile prowler was near,
it was the easiest thing in the world to pick
him off, caused a strange feeling to come over
the youthful sentinel, and his relief was great
when able to catch up his gun and slip back
in the protecting gloom of the night.</p>

<p>He had taken occasion, while near the fire,
to glance at his watch, and, like his companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was astonished to learn how brief the time was
that he had been on duty. It was less than
half an hour.</p>

<p>About the same period passed without the
most trifling alarm. Nick studiously held
himself in the background, where he moved
slowly about, dreading to sit down, though
often tempted to do so. He knew that so long
as he kept the erect posture his senses would
be at command, and it was far easier to do this
by motion, no matter how slight, than by
standing still.</p>

<p>He had reached the conclusion that the
night was to be as uneventful as those that had
preceded it, when once more one of the ponies
uttered the same sound that had disturbed him
before. Nick was startled, for the belief
flashed upon him that this signified something.
There must be some cause for the alarm of the
animals, outside of themselves.</p>

<p>He reflected for a minute upon the most
prudent thing to do. He dismissed the thought
of awaking the Texans, for, like Herbert, he
shrank from asking their help until certain it
was needed, for, by so doing, he confessed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
own inability to meet the danger, whatever it
might be.</p>

<p>He now determined to make a much larger
circuit than before, his object being to bring
the horses between him and the fire. This
would not only show the animals, but was
likely to reveal the disturbing cause. At the
same time, Nick himself could remain in the
gloom, where it was hardly possible to be seen.
The moon, which might have interfered with
the success of this plan, would not be above
the horizon for several hours to come.</p>

<p>In order to traverse the distance he had in
mind, he was forced to move around several
large rocks and bowlders, cross the small
stream which flowed near the camp, and pick
his way with the utmost care. Stillness was
necessary above all things.</p>

<p>The darkness, while favorable in many
respects, had its disadvantages, as was quickly
proven. At the moment when he believed he
was opposite the ponies, and, therefore, near
them, he stepped upon a rolling stone, and
despite his expertness, fell with a thump to
the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>He was impatient with himself, and could
hardly repress an angry exclamation, for a
snuff from one of the animals showed how
alert they were to the slightest disturbance.</p>

<p>“The next thing to be done,” reflected Nick,
“is to shoot off my rifle; then the job will be
in fine shape.”</p>

<p>But, so far as he could judge, no harm had
been done, and he pressed on with greater care
than before. It took considerable time to
reach the desired point, but it was attained at
last. The horses were in a direct line with the
camp fire, and he began stealing toward them.</p>

<p>This was the time for extreme caution, for, if
the least noise betrayed him, all chance of success
would be destroyed. It may be doubted,
however, whether either of the Texans himself
could have carried out the plan more skilfully
than did Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>When he halted, he was not fifty feet from
his own animal, and had approached him so
silently that no one of the ponies was disturbed.
They were silent, as if asleep.</p>

<p>But at the moment when Nick was motionless
and carefully studying the dark figures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
whose upper parts were shown against the
background of the fire, he saw one of the animals
raise his head higher than the others and
emit a snuff, louder than ever.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be that I caused that,” was the
decision of Nick, who was in a crouching posture;
“it’s something else that alarmed them,
and, whatever it is, it is closer to them than I
am.”</p>

<p>He was right, for hardly had he begun creeping
forward, when the head and shoulders of a
man slowly rose between him and the horses,
and in a direct line with the camp fire, which
revealed the upper part of his body as distinctly
as if stamped with ink against the
yellow background of flame.</p>

<p>“It’s a white man,” was Nick’s conclusion,
“and he is there for no good.”</p>

<p>The presence of the intruder now helped the
youth in his hurried but stealthy approach;
for, when the horses showed additional excitement,
perhaps, at the coming of a second person,
the stranger would believe it was caused
wholly by himself. Apprehending no approach,
too, from the rear, he would give no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
attention to that direction, but keep his eye on
the camp to be ready for any demonstration
from that quarter.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that he saw Nick when
he withdrew beyond the light, but he had no
reason to suspect he had flanked him and
passed round to the other side.</p>

<p>It took the sentinel but a few more minutes
to satisfy himself of the errand of the intruder.
Nick’s own pony was approached and obliged
to rise to his feet. The stranger was a horse
thief, making a stealthy raid upon the camp,
while all the campers but one were asleep.</p>

<p>Taking the head of Nick’s horse, he was in
the act of flinging himself upon his bare back,
when the youth stepped forward in the gloom
and called out:</p>

<p>“<i>Hands up, quicker than lightning!</i>”</p>

<p>Nick imitated as nearly as he could the
voice and manner of one of the Texans when
making a similar startling demand.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">BELL RICKARD.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK RIBSAM had no wish to figure as a
rough border character, who ordered his
captive to “throw up his hands,” when able
to secure “the drop on him”; but the youth
had the native shrewdness to suit himself to
the situation. He and Herbert had been in
the Lone Star State long enough to pick up a
good deal of information.</p>

<p>When he discovered the stranger among the
horses, there could be hardly a doubt of his
business, but he waited till he was in the act
of riding off with his own horse before he
called out the startling words which told the
thief he was caught.</p>

<p>A man who is used to getting the drop on
others is quite sure to know when that little
point is made on him. The intruder was on
the point of leaping upon the back of Nick’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
pony, but checked himself and promptly
reached both hands upward.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the drop on me, pard, this
time, but go easy,” said he in a voice as
cheery as if he were talking about the
weather.</p>

<p>“Face toward the fire, walk straight forward
and don’t stop, turn round, or try anything
till you get the word from me.”</p>

<p>All this time, the thief was striving to gain
a sight of the individual who held him at his
mercy. It was evident he did not recognize
the voice, and there may have been something
in Nick’s tones which led him to think he was
not a full grown man. He was standing erect,
with his Winchester levelled, and nothing
in the world was easier than for him to send a
bullet through his body.</p>

<p>Border law never would have questioned the
act: rather it would have blamed him for
showing mercy. But Nick Ribsam, like every
right-thinking person, looked upon the taking
of human life in its true light, and as never
right unless to save his own. The man before
him was trying to steal his property, but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
more. No doubt he would have been quick
to shoot Nick if their situations were reversed,
but this could not affect the views of the
youth. As yet he had no right to harm
him.</p>

<p>Nick assumed a ferocity that he was far
from feeling. He was playing a part, and doing
it well.</p>

<p>When the thief heard the command, he
hesitated, as if unwilling to obey it.</p>

<p>“I guess you hadn’t better insist on <i>that</i>,”
he said, with a half laugh, full of significance.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“If you start to foller me to the camp, my
pard, just behind you, will give it to you in
the neck.”</p>

<p>This was alarming, and for a moment Nick
was in doubt what to do. If he should start
to drive the horse thief before him, only to
find that his armed companion was doing the
same with him, the tables would be turned in
the highest style of the art.</p>

<p>But the youth’s brightness came to his aid.
He knew that if this man had a comrade in
his wrong doing, he would have put in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
appearance before matters had reached this
interesting stage: he never would have
remained in the background, while Nick was
securing the drop on the other.</p>

<p>He had no one with him. He was alone, and
was trying a trick on his captor.</p>

<p>“Walk on,” said Nick; “when your
partner shows up, we’ll attend to <i>his</i> case.”</p>

<p>The rogue saw there was no help for it, and,
without another word of protest, walked sullenly
in the direction of the camp fire.</p>

<p>The prisoner seemed to have concluded that,
inasmuch as he had to submit, his true plan
was to do so gracefully. He walked with a
certain dignity along the line pointed out,
while Nick kept a few paces to the rear, with
his Winchester ready for instant call.</p>

<p>It was the first time he was ever placed in
such a situation, and, as may be supposed, his
emotions were peculiar. As the figure in
front grew more distinct in the light of the
camp fire, he saw that he was of unusual size,
being at at least six feet tall, long-limbed, and
thin of frame. There could be no doubt he
was fully armed, with the exception of a rifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which, for some reason or other, was absent.
He had probably left it near by, in order that
nothing might hinder the best use of his arms
while committing his crime.</p>

<p>Nick cleverly shortened the space separating
them, for he was afraid of some trick on the
part of his captive. The scamp might open on
the sleeping cowboys and riddle them before
he could prevent. But such fears were causeless.
A course of that kind, as he himself
well knew, would insure his instant death at
the hands of his captor. It would have been
more reasonable had he turned like a flash,
when in the partial gloom, and let fly at Nick,
instead of pointing both hands at the stars
with such readiness when ordered so to do.</p>

<p>Had the fellow known what he learned a few
minutes later, he would have done that very
thing, and with almost certain success; for his
revolver could have been drawn and fired
before the youth would have suspected what
was going on.</p>

<p>At the moment the stranger came into full
view, near the fire and the sleepers, his captor
called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Halt! that will do!”</p>

<p>To Nick’s astonishment he saw two figures
rise like shadows from the ground. They were
Strubell and Lattin, who, flinging off their
blankets, stood each with revolver in hand,
ready for business. In fact, the loud call of
Nick was meant to awaken one or both of
them, for matters were assuming that shape
that the young man felt he must have their
help at once.</p>

<p>His loud summons, however, was unnecessary,
for the words which had already passed
between the captor and his prisoner had
brought them to their senses. Men like them
are light sleepers, and they were quick to discover
what was going on. More than that,
they recognized the voice of the intruder as
that of Bell Rickard, one of the most desperate
horse thieves in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Had the fellow tried the trick on Nick, the
Texans held themselves prepared to bound into
the affray, and rush it to a conclusion like
a cyclone, but the words they overheard gave
them a clue to what was going on. They saw
that the great connoisseur in horse flesh had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
put his foot in it in the worst kind of a way.
He was in the power of a boy, who had actually
made him a prisoner&mdash;a feat which the sheriffs
of half a dozen counties had been trying for
months in vain to do.</p>

<p>They hardly expected Nick to bring him
into camp without trouble; and though Strubell
and Lattin lay motionless on the ground,
listening and awaiting events, they had loosened
their blankets, drawn their weapons, and
were on the alert.</p>

<p>But the great Rickard, at the moment of
halting, found himself face to face with the
two cowboys, whom he had known well for several
years, and with whom he had exchanged
more than one shot, each fired with the intent
to kill.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Bell?” said Strubell, with a smile
on his handsome face which had a world of
meaning; “I hope you feel well, pard.”</p>

<p>“Tollyble, thank you,” replied the rogue,
extending his hand to each of the cowboys in
turn; “how is it with you?”</p>

<p>Lattin answered for both that they were
well, and then invited the new arrival to a seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by the fire. Rickard returned thanks as courteously
as if he were receiving the greatest
favor that could be granted him.</p>

<p>The next moment the three were lolling side
by side, as smiling and seemingly on as good
terms as though they were brothers. Bell carried
his brierwood with him, and Strubell
passed him his little sack of tobacco, from
which he helped himself, the party mingling
their smoke, smiling and even laughing at the
jocose remarks that were passed.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous slept on, undisturbed by
the noise, while Nick Ribsam stood in the
background, viewing the scene, which impressed
him as the most extraordinary he had
ever witnessed.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Lattin reflectively, “it’s
several months since we last met: do you
remember where it was?”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied Rickard, looking thoughtfully
at the stars, as if busy with memory,
“that it was in Laredo, at Brown’s place.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” struck in the cowboy; “we
had a shooting scrap, and I came near passing
in my checks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Bell, “I thought I had you
that time, but I fired too quick; the lights
went out, and then the room was full of smoke
and bullets. When things cleared up, you
wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lattin, “you folks were too
thick for me, and I lit out; I swum the Rio
Grande, just as Ben Thompson did when he
got catched in the same place and in the same
way. He got off without a scratch, as he did
hundreds of times before, only to catch it at
Santone at last, as he was bound to do sooner
or later.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">DEPARTURE OF THE GUEST.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">“BEN and me done travelled a good deal
together,” said Rickard, with a faint
sigh; “he was the quickest chap on the shoot
I ever met; I never knowed him to miss when
he had any show at all, and he was the
luckiest fellow that ever walked. Do you
know what Ben’s rule was?” asked Rickard,
turning toward the cowboys, as if about to
impart a piece of delightful news.</p>

<p>“It was to shoot whenever he had the
slightest excuse,” replied Strubell, who evidently
had little respect for one of the most
famous characters that Texas ever brought to
the surface.</p>

<p>“Whenever he got into a shooting scrap he
always let the other chap fire first; for then,
when <i>he</i> let fly, he had a good case of self-defence.
He always done that, as he told me
himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>I may be allowed to say that this remark
about Ben Thompson, once City Marshal of
Austin, was true. He informed me that he had
followed the rule for years, and it doubtless
helped to secure his acquittal in a large number
of the cases where he was tried for slaying
others, though the shameful admiration shown
him by all classes had much to do with his
immunity from legal punishment. As has
been hinted, however, there came a time when
Ben’s rule failed to work satisfactorily for
himself. It was down in San Antonio, the
scene of more than one of his crimes, that a
half dozen men worked in a volley from their
Winchesters ahead of Ben’s revolver, and he
died with his boots on, the last shot which he
fired before breathing his last causing the
death of one of his assailants.</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to give the conversation
which went on by the camp fire for
fully two hours, for it was not of a character
that can be commended to readers. There
were stirring reminiscences of those “bad
men,” known a few years ago respectively as
Bill Longley and John Wesley Hardin. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
suppose that Texas never produced two more
desperate men. When I saw Longley, he was
as handsome a person as I ever met, and
proved to be one of the few legally hanged
individuals in the Lone Star State, his taking
off occurring some years ago in Galveston.</p>

<p>Hardin was more ill-favored, as to personal
appearance. He was the son of a preacher,
and was named for one of the great founders
of Methodism. When I last talked with the
stumpy, broad-faced desperado he was in the
Austin penitentiary, serving a twenty-five
years’ sentence for horse stealing, the numerous
capital crimes he had committed not being
taken into account.</p>

<p>The point I am making is that Bell Rickard,
who, in his way, was as evil a man as any one
of those whom I have named, having entered
the camp as a prisoner, was treated as a guest.
No one unacquainted with the circumstances
would have suspected there was any feeling
other than the strongest friendship between
them.</p>

<p>They recalled the numerous stirring scrimmages
in which they had taken part, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
generally with Strubell and Lattin as the
deadly enemies of Rickard and his friends.
They laughed over the many close calls, when
their mutual escapes seemed to turn on a hair,
and even referred to those that were likely to
occur again in the near future.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam grew so interested that he forgot
his duty as sentinel, and, leaning on his
gun, stared with open mouth at the attenuated
Texan, with his scraggly beard, restless gray
eyes, and alert movements, as he smoked and
laughed and talked.</p>

<p>Suddenly Strubell turned to the youth and
said:</p>

<p>“Nick, I guess you had better take a look
at the animals; Bell may have some friends
around; if you get sight of any, don’t bother
to ask questions, but drop them at the first
shot.”</p>

<p>Rickard stopped in the middle of a remark
he was making, and looked at the young man
with a smile. Then he resumed his words,
and the conversation went on as before. Nick
walked slowly out to where the ponies were
lying on the ground, wondering and puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
by the new phase of southwestern life as he
saw it for the first time.</p>

<p>“Wal,” said Rickard, after talking a while
longer, as he rose to his feet, stretched his
limbs, and yawned, “I guess I’ll have to be
going, pards. By-by.”</p>

<p>“By-by,” returned Strubell and Lattin, the
latter adding:</p>

<p>“Take good care of yourself, Bell, till we
meet again.”</p>

<p>“The same to you,” he returned, moving
off in the darkness at a leisurely gait, which
showed that personal danger was the last
thought that entered his mind.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam, who was still standing near
the animals, saw the tall figure, with slightly
stooping shoulders, approaching.</p>

<p>“Helloa, younker, where are you?” he
asked, coming to a halt and peering round in
the gloom, his opportunity for seeing the
youth being less favorable than that of Nick
for observing him.</p>

<p>“I am here,” replied the lad, holding his
Winchester in a tight grip and apprehensive
of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only wanted to say good-by to you; I
think you and me will meet before many days;
till then, the best of luck to you.”</p>

<p>“The same to yourself,” replied Nick, who
kept his eyes on the fellow until he mingled
with the gloom and became invisible.</p>

<p>Then he walked back to the camp fire, in
answer to a whistle from Strubell, who asked
the time. It was not quite three o’clock,
but was so near that hour that the elder
Texan told him to lie down while he and
Lattin looked after things for the rest of the
night.</p>

<p>Nick hoped his friends would give an explanation
of the strange occurrence, but,
though he waited several minutes, no reference
was made to it, and he lay down in his
blanket beside the sleeping Herbert, who had
not once opened his eyes.</p>

<p>It was some time before the youth became
unconscious, for he was affected by what he
had seen and heard. He was convinced that,
however friendly the feeling appeared to be
between the Texans and their visitor, the latter
was a deadly enemy of himself. He believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
too, that Rickard’s parting words contained a
threat, and he was sure there would be a meeting
between them before many days.</p>

<p>Finally slumber overcame him and he did
not awake until he heard the voice of Herbert,
and all were astir, with day fully come.</p>

<p>Strubell was busy preparing coffee over the
coals, and cooking the remains of the maverick
shot the day before. The climate and the life
they were leading brought strong appetites,
and all fell to with the vigor of health and
strength. Herbert was in fine spirits, and said
he felt better than at any time since leaving
home. There was little doubt that he had received
wonderful benefit from his trip, and, if
nothing in the way of a set back occurred, he
had the best reason to believe he would be
fully restored to health, long before the time
came for his return home.</p>

<p>The Texans still avoided all reference to
Rickard, and Nick decided to await a good
opportunity before telling his young friend of
the remarkable incident. He was resolved to
ask no questions and to show no curiosity.</p>

<p>“I can stand it as long as they,” he said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
himself, “and shall give them their own time
to speak about it or leave it alone as they may
prefer.”</p>

<p>It took the party but a brief time to load up
their two pack animals, and to saddle, bridle,
and mount their ponies. Then, when they
faced the northwest, they formed a picturesque
sight.</p>

<p>Each of the four was mounted on a wiry
pony of Spanish stock, active, intelligent, and
enduring. Not one of them had ever felt the
touch of currycomb or brush. Nick and Herbert,
who had aimed to equip themselves as
much like their adult companions as possible,
were provided with ponderous saddles of wood
and leather, weighing fully a dozen pounds
apiece, with a pommel almost six inches in
diameter. Those of the cowboys were quite
costly, being sprinkled with silver stars on
different parts of their surface.</p>

<p>Two cinches were required to hold each of
the saddles in place, a forward and a flank
girth. The wardrobe of the Texans has
already been described, but I should have
stated that the boys had imitated them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that respect also. They were provided with
the broad-brimmed wool hat, known by the
Mexican name of sombrero, with a jacket of
ducking, shirts of calico or hickory, trousers
of stout stuff, over which were worn leather
leggings. All had heavy boots, to which
were attached two-inch rowels, and the pack
animals, besides the heavy blankets, simple
cooking utensils, and various articles, carried
a slicker of oiled linen for each, which, when
the weather was threatening, enveloped the
rider from head to heels.</p>

<p>There were two articles, however, carried by
the cowboys which the boys did not have.
Those were lariats (called in Southern California
only by the name of lasso). They were
about forty feet long and were composed of
eight pliable rawhide thongs, plaited into
ropes of a half-inch diameter. Strubell and
Lattin were experts in the use of the lariat, an
accomplishment which the boys could not
hope to attain, since they had deferred the
necessary practice until too late in life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">DANGER IN THE EAST.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE sun was no more than fairly above
the horizon when the party were on the
move, headed in the direction named. The
expected norther did not come, the weather
continuing as perfect as heart could wish.
The uneven ground rendered the progress slow
for a couple of hours, the horsemen being
obliged to pick their way with care; but, by
bearing to the right, better ground was
reached, and they struck into an easy gallop
which lasted for several hours.</p>

<p>“Strubell,” said Herbert, who with Nick
was riding beside the Texan, the other being
at the rear with the pack animals, “do you
expect to find any use for that lasso?”</p>

<p>“You mean the <i>lariat</i>,” replied the cowboy,
looking down at the rope coiled at his
saddle; “can’t say, but Baker and I make it
a rule to go prepared for business. We may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
strike a job in New Mexico, after taking a
look at the ranch for Mr. Lord.”</p>

<p>“But you could get them there.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but I’ve used this for years,
just as Baker has his, and we are so accustomed
to them that we prefer to take them
with us, just as you will soon grow to prefer
your pony and your Winchester above all
others.”</p>

<p>“When is the harvest time, as you may call
it, for cattle?” asked Nick, who was always
on the lookout for a chance to increase his
store of knowledge.</p>

<p>“The spring; that’s when the big herds are
put up for the drive, and that’s the season
too, when the yearly round-up takes place.”</p>

<p>“What’s that for?”</p>

<p>“To apportion the unmarked calves and
yearlings among the owners of stock on the
range, so they can be branded.”</p>

<p>“I should think there would be a confusion
of brands.”</p>

<p>“No; that can never happen, for the law
requires the brand to be recorded in the
county clerk’s office. It is generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
initials of the owner’s name, with perhaps
some device to help distinguish it. The
county clerk sees to it that no two are the
same. But,” added the Texan, “the law compels
every cattle owner to record also with the
county clerk the ear-marks, crops, half-crops,
upper and under bits, upper and under slopes,
splits, swallow-forks, and jingle-bobs. When
all this is done, the ranchman can identify his
property as easily as you could pick out your
own father in a crowd.”</p>

<p>“Suppose a lot of branded cattle are sold?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“That seller is compelled to counterbrand
them, and in case they are driven from the
State, the buyer is obliged to road-brand them
with a device different from his regular brand,
and must record it in every county through
which he passes.”</p>

<p>“I should think some of the cattle would
become pretty well covered with brands.”</p>

<p>“So they do; after a few shiftings about,
I have seen them so thickly branded that there
seemed no place for anything new in that line.
It doesn’t require many transfers to do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
when the burned letters, as I have seen them,
are nearly a foot long.”</p>

<p>“How is the branding done?”</p>

<p>“When convenient, the animal is driven
between two parallel lines of fencing, called a
chute, bars being placed before and behind
him. He is then helpless, and the operator
does the work at his leisure. But fences
(except the wire kind that the big owners are
stretching across the country) are scarce, and
we generally have to go to the help of the
brander.”</p>

<p>“How do you manage it?”</p>

<p>“Easily enough; slip about eight feet of
the end of the lariat through the ring, and,
putting a loop at the other end, over the
pommel of the saddle, I gather the coils into
my bridle hand, holding the noose in my right,
and start my pony on a gallop. The animal
that I want breaks into a run. I quickly get
near enough to drop the noose over its head
or fore feet, and the pony wheels the other
way and braces himself for the shock that he
knows is coming and which throws the animal
to the ground. The minute he goes down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the branders seize him by the head and tail,
and the hot iron does its work.”</p>

<p>“The operation must be painful,” suggested
Herbert.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Strubell, “I suppose the
animal doesn’t enjoy it overmuch, but it isn’t
so bad as many think, for the brander must
take great care not to burn through the skin
into the flesh.”</p>

<p>“What harm would be done by <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“The brand would be blotched, and a good
many dishonest people would find an excuse
for getting their brands mixed; but that isn’t
the worst trouble,” added the cowboy, “for
after the branding comes the blow-fly, which
is the pest of Texas.”</p>

<p>“What is his style of working?”</p>

<p>“He deposits his eggs under the raw sore,
and, before long, thousands of screw worms
are eating their way toward the vitals of the
animal.”</p>

<p>“What is done to check them?”</p>

<p>“We have different remedies, which only
half do their work, but the best that I know
of is cresylic ointment. In order to apply it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
however, the animal must be roped and sometimes
thrown down.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if the cowboy has more work than
play in his business,” said Nick, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Strubell turned and stared at him a moment,
as if pitying his ignorance.</p>

<p>“If you have any doubt about it, just try
it for six months or a year. We spend most
of our time in the saddle from daylight till
dark. When on the trail, our diet is bacon,
bread, and coffee, and not overmuch of that. I
have gone twenty hours without a mouthful,
for the simple reason that I hadn’t the time
to ride to the cook wagon to get it. When
one pony gave out, I jumped on another and
rode him like a house afire.”</p>

<p>“What was the cause for such hard work?”</p>

<p>“Chiefly stampedes, which set the animals
wild. When following the Old Cattle Trail,
northward through Texas and Kansas, I have
had five thousand cattle scattered to every
point of the compass by a thunder-storm,
despite all we could do to keep them together.
Sometimes they become crazy for water, start
bellowing on a full run, and crowd into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
first stream so fast that a hundred or two are
drowned; then, when the night is still and no
air stirring, nor the slightest cause, so far as
you can see, exists for alarm, something will
set them off again. The only explanation
that I could ever think of was that the animals
are troubled now and then with bad dreams,
and by their cavorting frighten the others out
of their wits.”</p>

<p>“They must be guarded carefully at night?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; our men are divided into three
reliefs, which makes it a little harder than we
have it now. When the stampede breaks out,
the riders have no let up night or day till the
cattle are brought together again. Then, too,
the Kiowas or Comanches may take it into
their heads to try a little cattle speculation.
They are all fine horsemen and rifle-shots, and
a half dozen of the scamps can make things as
lively on a dark night as a nest of hornets.
However, we like it for all that,” said the
Texan, “because it’s the only business we
know; but these big cattle owners, that are
fencing in most of Texas with their barbed
wire, will soon take it away from us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>At this juncture, Lattin touched his pony
with his spur, and placed him alongside the
others.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said he, “that you would p’int
that machine of yours off there to the east, and
let us know what you make of it.”</p>

<p>His outstretched arm showed the direction
named, and his friends naturally turned their
attention toward that point of the compass.
They were on the plain, where the grass grew
plentifully, the hilly portions being in sight
several miles to their left.</p>

<p>Before the field glass was called into use, all
saw, seemingly in the very rim of the horizon,
several horsemen moving apparently over a
course parallel with their own, since Lattin
said they had been in sight for nearly an hour,
and were neither more nor less distinct than
when first observed.</p>

<p>The glasses were passed from one to the
other, and the parties were closely studied.
The instruments were of great help, giving to
our friends a knowledge which otherwise they
could not have obtained.</p>

<p>All agreed that there were three horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and that one, possibly two, were white men.
The third might have belonged to the same
race, but, for some cause, the Texans declared
that he was a half-breed, known as Jim-John,
one of the worst rogues in the Southwest.</p>

<p>“If you know <i>him</i>,” said Nick, “you ought
to know the others.”</p>

<p>“So I do,” quietly replied Strubell; “one
is Bell Rickard, that you introduced to us last
night. They’re a bad lot, and we’re bound to
have trouble with them before morning.”</p>

<p>Little did the sagacious Texan suspect the
startling manner in which his words were to be
verified.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">STRANGE PROCEEDINGS.</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">THE elder Texan turned to the boys and
said:</p>

<p class="pn">“I must ask you to excuse Baker and me
for a few minutes, while we discuss a little private
business.”</p>

<p>It was a singular request, but Nick and Herbert
nodded their heads. Striking their ponies
into a quick gallop, the cowboys rode a hundred
yards or so in advance, before bringing
their animals down to a walk. The gait of the
youths was the same.</p>

<p>The remark made by Strubell concerning
Rickard, caused Herbert to ask what it meant.
Nick told him the story, adding:</p>

<p>“They are talking now about him and the
others: look at them!”</p>

<p>The Texans were certainly discussing some
subject with great earnestness. Inasmuch as
they kept glancing to the eastward, gesticulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and often pointing in that direction, there
was little doubt that Nick was right in his
surmise as to the theme of their conversation.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it can be,” said Herbert,
after watching the couple, who modulated
their voices so that not a word could be recognized;
“it seems strange that they should
treat the horse thief as a friend, when they
know him to be an enemy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have been trying to figure it out; I
supposed they would make it clear to me, but
though I heard them speak about it to each
other this morning, they took care not to give
me a word in the way of explanation. I shall
not ask them, though I was never more curious
to learn anything in all my life.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be that Strubell and Lattin are
on friendly terms with Rickard?” suggested
Herbert.</p>

<p>“I might think so, after what we have
just seen, though it seems cruel to suspect
them of anything like that. Mr. Lord has
known them for years, and says two more
honest men never lived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are brighter than I am, Nick; what
is <i>your</i> theory?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is clear that Strubell and Lattin
had the choice of shooting down Rickard
when I drove him into camp, or of letting him
go. They knew it was of no use to ask a
pledge of him in payment for their kindness,
for he wouldn’t regard any promise as binding;
so, not willing to treat him as he deserved,
perhaps they took the fellow for what
he was, and then let him go.”</p>

<p>“You may be right, but the explanation
doesn’t amount to much, and doesn’t satisfy
me.”</p>

<p>“Nor me either. I would like to hear
yours.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any. They are hard at it
now!”</p>

<p>The Texans were talking more excitedly
than ever, but did not forget to keep their
voices so low that no stray word reached the
ears of the puzzled youths.</p>

<p>The conference, however, speedily reached
its conclusion. Their talking ceased, and,
bringing their horses to a standstill, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
waited for the boys and the pack horses to
join them.</p>

<p>The faces of Strubell and Lattin showed signs
of the stirring conversation, but, as the boys
anticipated, they were silent as to the theme.</p>

<p>“We must make a change in our course,”
said the elder, who immediately turned the
head of his pony to the westward, in the
direction of the hills among which they had
spent the previous night. It was near noon,
and the major part of the day was gone, when
they reached the rougher section where the
Texans said the camp was to be made.</p>

<p>They showed their usual good judgment in
the selection of a favorable site, for it was
near another running stream, larger than the
previous one, though the current was roiled
and lukewarm. They might count themselves
fortunate, however, that they were able to
find water at all; for thirst has caused the
death of untold thousands of cattle on the
vast plains of Texas, and brought great suffering
to those who have ventured not alone
upon the Llano Estacado, but in other localities
where moisture is almost unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The pack horses were unloaded, saddles and
bridles removed, and the ponies allowed to
crop the scanty grass. It was too early for
the regular evening meal, but considerable
fuel was gathered; and, much sooner than
there seemed to be any need for it, a fire was
started, the smoke from which rose vertically,
and was of so dark a color that it must have
been visible for a long distance across the
plain.</p>

<p>During all this time the three horsemen in
the eastern horizon were not forgotten. The
glasses were often turned thither, and there
could be no doubt that Rickard and his companions
were keeping our friends in sight.
Evidently they were determined that they
should not be lost.</p>

<p>The use of spy glasses has never been common
among the cowmen, who are generally
gifted with such keen eyesight that they scorn
everything in the nature of artificial help.
Counting upon this fact, it was not unlikely
that Rickard believed that, by hovering on
the line of invisibility, he would escape attention,
or at least suspicion, on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Texans. Had he known of the field glasses,
he must have made an important change in
his programme.</p>

<p>The fact that our friends were without a
particle of food did not cause them concern.
They were not likely to suffer from starvation,
for, beside the stray cattle that they were warranted
in using in an emergency (always holding
themselves ready to reimburse the owner
when it could be done), there were antelope
and other animals to be found among the
hills.</p>

<p>But Lattin stated that, unless some kind
of game would be accommodating enough
to come forward and offer itself as a sacrifice
to their needs, they would content themselves
with a good cup of coffee around, making up
for the light meal when morning should come.</p>

<p>When the sun sank behind the hills, Rickard
and his party became invisible to the naked
eye. The supposition might have been that
they had withdrawn and would be seen no
more, but for the story told by the field
glasses. Under their power it was discovered
that the scamps had dismounted near a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
arroya or natural depression, and compelled
their animals to lie down. Seating themselves
at the same time on the grass, they filled too
small an angle for the unassisted eye to note
them across the intervening space.</p>

<p>Strubell turned to Lattin and spoke:</p>

<p>“Bell’s cunning, but he does not dream
about the spy glasses.”</p>

<p>“We’re bound to hear from him before
morning,” replied Lattin.</p>

<p>They did not mean that their words should
be overheard, but Nick caught them all,
though he affected ignorance.</p>

<p>The next sentences were meant for the youths.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better move over the trail into
the hills, Ard?” asked the younger Texan, as
though the idea had just come to him.</p>

<p>“Why should we do that?” inquired the
other, as if in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, you know of that spring where we’ve
camped many a time, and once had the brush
with half a hundred Comanches. There are
more rocks and bowlders there, and everything
is a blamed sight better for a fight than it is
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Baker, you aint so foolish as to
think Bell and the others mean to disturb us?”
asked Strubell, apparently forgetting the words
uttered by himself only a few minutes before.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not, but you know as well as
me that it won’t do to trust him further than
you can see him.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Baker, what will be better,”
spoke up Strubell, like a man with a new and
brilliant idea; “we’ll send the boys ahead to
the spring with the pack horses, while we
wait here and find out just what Bell is up to.”</p>

<p>“That is a good plan,” added Lattin heartily;
“let’s do it.”</p>

<p>The Texans now turned to Nick and Herbert,
as though they did not suspect they had
caught any of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Boys, we want to watch Bell and the others
for a while, and have made up our minds to
let you ride some distance over the trail, while
we stay here and watch. I have proposed it,
and Baker agrees that the plan is a good one.
You have no objections?”</p>

<p>It occurred to Nick to ask in what way it
was likely to improve their eyesight and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
power of the glasses, by sending him and
Herbert off. Surely their presence or absence
could not operate one way or the other. The
proposition was not very profound or bright,
but, keeping back his thoughts, he promptly
answered:</p>

<p>“Herbert and I are always ready to do
cheerfully whatever you decide is best for
us.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!&mdash;spoken like a man. Now, you
see the trail just beyond,” added Strubell,
pointing to a faintly marked path; “it has
been used since the days of old Moses Austin
and Sam Houston, and is so plain that you
can’t miss it. It leads into the hills for a quarter
of a mile, and then turns north through a
sort of valley. A little more than half a mile
further, and you will come upon one of the
prettiest springs of water in Texas. There’s
where you will unsaddle and make camp for
to-night.”</p>

<p>“When will you join us?”</p>

<p>“We hope to do so in the course of a few
hours, but don’t be alarmed if you see nothing
of us before morning.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">BEFORE parting with the Texans, Nick
Ribsam handed his field glass to Strubell,
with the remark that he and Lattin would be
likely to find it of use, and it could be well
spared, since Herbert had one of his own.
The coffee was prepared before the breaking
up took place, for the cooking utensils were to
go with the boys, and the men did not expect
to have much leisure for preparing the delicious
refreshment.</p>

<p>The trail, to which several references have
been made, showed no evidence of having been
recently travelled, though, in the course of
time, a great many animals must have found
their way through the hills by that route,
which Nick took, with the pack horses stringing
after, and Herbert bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>It was too strait to admit of two horsemen
riding abreast, and there were places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there was none too much room for a single
animal. The path wound in and out among
and around bowlders and large rocks, with
stunted vegetation here and there, all the time
steadily ascending, until a height of several
hundred feet was attained, beyond which the
descent was gradual, until the same level was
reached on the other side.</p>

<p>The distance across the ridge or small mountain
spur has been named&mdash;about one-fourth
of a mile. It is probable that it was first made
by the feet of wild animals when they were
more numerous in the neighborhood, and was
afterward used by Indians and hunters in
passing to and fro through that portion of
Texas. It was not the first time that the
speechless part of creation has blazed the path
for the pioneer to follow after them.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam, having placed himself at the
head of the little party, started his pony,
Jack, on a moderate walk, the others following
at the same pace, with Herbert and his Jill at
the rear. They had named their animals that
day, and both were surprised at the intelligence,
speed, and endurance they developed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
It was impossible for the boys not to form a
fondness for the ponies, since they were so
worthy, and showed a strong affection for their
masters.</p>

<p>The sun was well above the horizon, and the
youths had plenty of time at command. At
the highest portion of the path, where the
space was broad enough for a dozen animals
to stand side by side, the boys came together.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Nick, from his saddle to
Herbert on his right, “that you understand
what all this means.”</p>

<p>“I suspect,” replied the elder, “that Strubell
and Lattin are preparing for a fight with
Rickard and his men.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt that’s it, and they want us
out of the way; they are pretty shrewd fellows,
but I can’t help wondering what answer
Strubell would have made, if I had asked him
how our absence would be likely to help him
and Lattin better than our presence. Well,
no doubt they have good reason to want us
beyond gunshot; we couldn’t give them any
help, and might prove a hindrance, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
think too much of us to allow us to run into
danger when they can prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Nick,” said Herbert, as if giving expression
to a thought that had been in his mind
for some time; “I wish I could think as you
do about things, but I can’t.”</p>

<p>The younger lad looked at him with surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the odds, if we don’t see everything
in exactly the same light? But I am
not sure that I understand you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s dismount for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The open space where the four animals were
standing was so walled in by masses and piles
of stone and vegetation that, although considerably
higher than their friends at the foot
of the ridge, the latter were invisible. By
climbing a large, irregular bowlder, the Texans
were in plain sight.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them see us,” said Herbert, “but
let’s watch them for a while: maybe you can
explain things, and maybe you can’t.”</p>

<p>Nick was a little disturbed by the words of
Herbert, though it should be stated that it was
not the mind of either to suspect the Texans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of anything but the truest friendship toward
them; but it looked very much as if something
was on foot which they wished to keep
secret from their younger companions.</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin were standing beside
each other, with their whole attention directed
eastward, where Rickard and his companions
were known to be. At the moment the boys
observed them, the elder Texan was holding
the field glass levelled, while Lattin was doing
what he could in the way of observation by
shading his eyes with one hand. They were
too far off to learn whether any words passed
between the cowboys.</p>

<p>“I don’t notice anything to cause question,”
remarked Nick, after viewing the
couple for several minutes. “They are
simply studying the horse thieves over yonder,
in the hope of finding out something about
their purposes. We have been doing the same
thing, off and on, for a number of hours.”</p>

<p>“And you think there will be a fight?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way; it seems to me that
Strubell and Lattin are satisfied that those
fellows yonder are bent on stealing our horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and that they are likely to hang to us for
days and nights, in the hope of getting a good
chance to do so. So our friends have made
up their minds that the best thing is to settle
it at once, and by sending us off they have
cleared the deck for action.”</p>

<p>“You put it very well,” said Herbert,
whose admiration of his companion’s brightness
never grew less; “and maybe, since you
have explained some things so well, you will
tell us about others.”</p>

<p>The youths now took turns in studying the
group across the plain. The sun was out of
sight behind the hills to their rear, but the
eastern horizon, being relieved from the glare,
was more favorable than before for observation
through the instrument.</p>

<p>The three horses of the rogues were seen to
be on their feet, with their riders standing
beside them, as if about to climb into the saddles.
One of the company, evidently Rickard
himself, was several paces in advance of the
others, as motionless as a statue, and evidently
staring in turn toward the Texans at the foot
of the ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks to me,” said Nick, passing the
glass back to Herbert, “as though he is using
a field glass: can it be possible?”</p>

<p>“What is there so wonderful about that?
The cowboys may not be fond of spy glasses,
but it would be strange if some of them did
not employ all the help they could get in
their business.”</p>

<p>Ceasing the conversation for the moment,
the boys gave their whole attention to seeing
what they could see.</p>

<p>Lattin, having passed the glass to Strubell,
stepped back to where the fire was beginning
to burn low, and threw on a few sticks. When
the ascending smoke increased in volume, he
took off his broad-brimmed hat and waved it
in an odd way over the blaze. The result was
that the volume of smoke, instead of ascending
vertically, was broken into what might be
called a regular irregularity, the appearance
being peculiar and different from anything the
the youths had ever observed before.</p>

<p>“That’s a signal to the horse thieves,” said
Herbert, “and I would give a good deal to
know what it means.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“So would I,” added Nick, more disturbed
by the sight than he was willing to admit.</p>

<p>It looked as if Herbert was right, but, if so,
the singular feature of the business was that
all the signalling seemed to be done by Strubell
and Lattin. Nothing, so far as could be perceived,
was sent in response by Rickard.</p>

<p>If there were actual communication going
on between the parties, it was beyond the
power of Nick and Herbert to frame a satisfactory
explanation. Why intercourse should
be held at such long range, when seemingly
there was no reason for the mutual playing off,
was a problem beyond ordinary acuteness.</p>

<p>But while the two were speculating, Herbert,
with his field glass to his eye, began
sweeping every part of the visible horizon.
He had no special object in doing this, but
thought he might perceive other horsemen,
who had nothing to do with their friends or
enemies.</p>

<p>Suddenly he startled Nick by an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Follow the direction of my finger!” he
said, “and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed almost north, that is in a line
parallel with the ridge which they were crossing;
and, without the aid of the field glass,
Nick observed a second column of smoke of
precisely the same appearance as that produced
by Baker Lattin at the foot of the
hills.</p>

<p>Apparently it was a mile distant, its location
being at one corner of a right-angled
triangle, with the horse thieves and Texans at
the other two respective corners. The course
of the ridge shut Strubell and Lattin from
the sight of those that were managing the
second fire. The parties could not have
caught the first mutual glimpse, and yet
nothing was more reasonable to believe than
that they were telegraphing important messages
back and forth to each other.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN UNEXPECTED SIGNAL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE mystery to the lads was deeper than
ever. Matters were inexplainable before,
and now they were still more involved.</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” said Herbert, “that the
best course for us is to stay where we are and
watch things.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would suit me better, and yet it
would be hardly right, after our promise to
Strubell and Lattin. They asked us to ride
forward to the spring, and we promised to do
so. If we stay here we break our word.
True, we would be sure to pick up some interesting
information, but it would be of a kind
that they don’t want us to have, at least for
the present.”</p>

<p>“You are right, as you always are,” replied
Herbert; “it did not occur to me in
that light; let us go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking back to where their ponies were
waiting, they remounted and started forward
in the same order as before. Both were busy
with their thoughts, and filled with a disquiet
which disturbed them a good deal. They
would have been glad to drive away the
misgivings, but could not. The conviction
was strong on each that a grave crisis was at
hand, and that, before the setting sun showed
itself again, every member of the party was
likely to become involved in greater peril than
they had faced since their union.</p>

<p>The trail continued descending at the
moderate rate of its ascent, and, at the point
named by the Texans, it turned sharply northward,
following a course parallel to the ridge
and at its base.</p>

<p>They expected to travel about a half mile
over the new course, which they found freer
from bowlders and obstructions than before.
The horses moved with a brisker pace, as if
they knew camp was not far off, and a long
and grateful rest was at hand.</p>

<p>At the moment of emerging from the hills,
and reaching the lower level, the sun dipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
below the horizon and twilight began. Far to
the westward stretched the broad prairie, with
the faint blue line of a distant chain of mountains,
resting like a cloud against the clear sky
beyond.</p>

<p>The sweep of the field glass failed to reveal
any living creature. It seemed to the youths
as if they were entering upon a vast solitude,
where they were the only intruders. They
pushed along the path in silence, the sounds
of their animals’ hoofs being all that broke the
solemn stillness. Nick turned his head now
and then, and, looking over the backs of the
pack horses, saw that Herbert was more
thoughtful than usual. His face wore a grave
expression, which proved that the situation
oppressed him.</p>

<p>“But,” added Nick to himself, “suppose his
suspicions are right, what harm can result? If
Strubell and Lattin are friends of Rickard,
and have an understanding with him, in what
way can it affect us? Mr. Lord may be
deceived into believing they are honest, but we
have nothing to fear. None of them has ill
designs against us, and, whatever the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the parties, our friends would never permit
the outlaws to molest us.”</p>

<p>Nick might have persuaded himself fully
to this faith, but for the remembrance of the
scene the night before. He could not forget
the threat of Rickard as he walked off in the
gloom, nor would that bad man forgive the
indignity put upon him by a boy in the presence
of a couple of acquaintances. Such characters
are as revengeful as American Indians,
and he would lose no opportunity of paying
him therefor. It is a sad fact that about half
the world are engaged in “getting even” with
the other half, for fancied wrongs received at
their hands.</p>

<p>Nick had not ridden far when he abruptly
checked his pony and called to Herbert:</p>

<p>“Halloo! here’s something we didn’t bargain
for.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the surprised Herbert.</p>

<p>“Come forward and see.”</p>

<p>The elder was about to dismount, when he
perceived that, by crowding, he could force Jill
alongside of his friend. He did so, and discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that which had checked the procession.</p>

<p>The trail which they had been following
divided, one branch turning to the right and
the other to the left. The divergence was so
slight, that there could not be much space
between the two at a considerable distance
beyond, unless the angle increased.</p>

<p>“It’s singular that neither Strubell nor Lattin
said anything about this,” remarked Nick,
looking inquiringly at Herbert, who was following
the path with his eye.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand that any more than I
understand the other matters we have been
talking about. How are we going to tell which
is the right course?”</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the youths had
been riding northward, along the base of the
ridge, where the ground was comparatively
level; but for some distance the trail turned
slightly in among the hills, compelling a
moderate descent, and a more winding course,
through and around the bowlders and obstructions.
At the point where Nick had reined up
his pony this trend became more pronounced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
while the path on the left led down toward the
foot of the hills.</p>

<p>The difficulty lay in the fact that each was
marked with equal distinctness, and it was,
therefore, beyond their power to decide with
certainty which was the right one to follow.
This was proven when Nick gave it as his
belief that the one on the right was the main
trail, while Herbert was equally positive that
the reverse was the case; how, therefore, was
the question to be settled?</p>

<p>“There’s one thing clear to me,” said Nick,
seeing how matters stood; “Strubell and Lattin
are certain that we are not placing ourselves
in any danger by leaving them behind
and riding on alone; for we agree that the
movement was meant for our good. We
haven’t caught the first sight of man or animal,
so we need not be troubled. Now, I will
follow the upper path, which I think is the
right one, while you take the lower. That
will be better than for each of us to take the
wrong course, and then come back to travel
the same distance along the right one.”</p>

<p>“But how will we manage it?” asked Herbert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
who was not well pleased with the
proposal, despite his confidence in Nick’s
judgment.</p>

<p>“In the first place, we shall not be far
apart after going a long way, unless there
is a more abrupt divergence than we see
here. If I reach the spring, as I feel sure
I shall, I will call to you and you can join
me.”</p>

<p>“By riding back here to this fork&mdash;what
will I gain by that?”</p>

<p>“I think you can save considerable distance
by riding across the intervening ground,
though, if that can’t be done, and you have to
double on your own trail, it will be but one,
instead of two, who has to do it. If we keep
together, and both go wrong, we will have
double work, while by dividing, one is as sure
to be right as the other is to go astray; consequently
half the labor will be saved.”</p>

<p>“What about the pack horses?”</p>

<p>“I guess they would better go with me.”</p>

<p>Herbert laughed.</p>

<p>“That shows your faith in your own theory,
but I am willing, though just as sure as you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that you are putting extra duty on the animals.”</p>

<p>“When I strike the spring,” continued
Nick, with a smile, “I will give a whistle,
which you will understand as a call for you,
and you can cut across lots or gallop back to
this point and follow after me.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” added Herbert, “I don’t see
that the matter is very important, for we shall
not be separated long. I will whistle to you
when I reach the spring. Since I have only
Jill, I will press on faster than you, and save
you extra work.”</p>

<p>With this laughing parting, each set out to
verify his own theory, confident that they
would soon come together again.</p>

<p>Nick was inclined to force his pony into a
gallop, for the trail was so free from obstructions
that this could have been easily done,
but he was afraid it would disorganize the
pack horses. Their loads were not heavy and
were generally fixed so securely in place that
they could gallop whenever required, without
risk to the property; but the goods had been
hastily adjusted, when on the other side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
ridge, and were likely to become disarranged,
for the animals were so trained to follow their
leader that when he increased his pace they
were quite sure to do the same.</p>

<p>“I knew I was right!” exclaimed Nick,
with a laugh, after riding a fourth of a mile,
as he came upon a broad, deep, crystalline
spring, which warranted all the praise the
Texans had bestowed on it; “I don’t see why
Herbert was so positive; I’ve got him this
time, and he’ll have to own up.”</p>

<p>As agreed upon, he placed the tip of his
finger and thumb against his tongue to emit
the signal; but, before he could do so, the
very same call reached him from the foot of
the hills. Herbert had summoned him to
retrace his steps to the fork and join him!</p>

<p>“What under the sun can <i>that</i> mean?”
asked the amazed Nick, holding his thumb
and finger in front of his mouth, undecided
what to do.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE ABSENCE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK RIBSAM might well be puzzled.
Just ahead and on his right was the most
enchanting natural spring of water that he had
ever beheld. It was circular in shape, fully
two yards in diameter and ten or twelve inches
deep in the middle. From several places on
the bottom the water bubbled up in a way
that tumbled the sand in miniature fountains,
which hid the current flinging the particles upward
from below.</p>

<p>This basin was so clear that at first sight one
was doubtful whether there was any water
there at all; but the bubbling sand and the
vigorous stream flowing away and across the
trail, and losing itself among the rocks and
vegetation, removed all question on that
point.</p>

<p>The spring was partly shaded by a black
bowlder leaning so far over that it seemed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the point of tumbling in, while the scene in the
immediate vicinity was rougher than any
through which they had passed since crossing
the ridge.</p>

<p>Domestic as well as wild animals are quick
to discern the presence of water, and Nick had
seen proof in the actions of Jack that he
knew he was near the spring, some time before
he himself knew it. The three were so pleased
that they hastened their pace, and crowded
their noses into the cool element, of which they
drank with an enjoyment beyond description.</p>

<p>The youth meant to have a deep refreshing
draught himself, but he had not the heart to
check the ponies. He could wait better than
they; they were not unclean animals, and the
spring would quickly free itself of all traces
of the contact with their silken noses.</p>

<p>But while Jack was stretching his head
downward and standing with one fore leg bent
at the knee, the better to reach the water, his
rider prepared to give the call for Herbert to
join him, when he was taken all aback by
catching precisely the same signal from his
friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>There could be no mistake about it: he had
heard it too often to confound it with any
other sound.</p>

<p>He had noticed, while riding along the trail,
that the divergence became more pronounced,
thus separating him from Herbert by a greater
distance than he had anticipated. As nearly
as he could judge from the whistle, his friend
was nearly, if not quite an eighth of a mile
away, and between them the slope was so
filled with rocks, bowlders, and stunted vegetation
that travelling with a horse was out of the
question. A trained mountaineer would find
the task anything but an easy one. Herbert,
therefore, must turn squarely about, and ride
back to the fork in the trail, thus travelling
double the distance made by Nick and the
pack horses.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection convinced the latter
that Herbert had made a natural mistake.
The stream, winding its way in that direction,
probably formed a pool near the other part, so
large and clear and beautiful that the youth
mistook it for the spring itself.</p>

<p>“But he will see his error,” reflected Nick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sending out the ringing blast by which he had
summoned his friend many a time; “he
doesn’t like to own up, but, when he looks
upon this, he can’t help himself.”</p>

<p>Nick was convinced that there were few
such natural springs in that section of Texas,
though similar ones are found in plenty further
east and among some of the mountainous
portions.</p>

<p>The horses having had their fill, stepped
back, and Nick began his preparations for
spending the night. Everything was taken
from the backs and heads of the animals and
placed in a pile on the ground near at hand,
while they were left to crop the grass, which
was green and quite luxuriant in the vicinity
of the stream.</p>

<p>By the time everything was complete, darkness
had come. The animals were not tethered,
for there was little to be feared of their running
away, unless interfered with by outsiders, of
which no one dreamed.</p>

<p>Nick now began to look for the coming of
Herbert. Both paths were so easily travelled
that he ought to appear in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
twenty minutes, and a full half hour had gone
by.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether anything could have
happened to him,” said Nick, gazing down
the trail in the gathering gloom, and feeling a
renewal of the fears that troubled him so much
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He once more whistled with the power of a
steam engine, and paused for the response. It
was impossible, as he had learned long before,
that Herbert should have made his way on
horseback across the space separating the
trails, and he, therefore, gave his attention to
the route over which he himself had just
travelled.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen of his friend, and
the suspicion came to Nick that possibly he
was pouting because of his mistake, but the
thought was dismissed the next minute as unworthy
of Herbert, who, if disposed in that
direction, was in no mood to do so at the present
time.</p>

<p>“But where can he be?” repeated Nick, recalling
the preceding winter, when he went
astray in the pursuit of the second moose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
caused himself and Pierre Ardeau no end of
worriment of mind. As the darkness increased,
Nick Ribsam became aware of another
discomforting fact. The wind was beginning
to blow, and the cold was rapidly increasing.
The norther prophesied by the Texans was at
hand.</p>

<p>This being evident, he quickly prepared for
it. He had gathered a quantity of limbs and
twigs, but they were unlighted, he intending
to await the arrival of his friend Herbert; but
he now started the fire as quickly as possible,
for, aside from its needed warmth, it would do
much to dispel the gloom oppressing him.</p>

<p>Few who have not experienced a Texan
norther can understand their fierce suddenness.
I was once riding in a stage in the southern
part of the State, the day was mild and
balmy, and a middle-aged gentleman from New
York sat in the seat with me. His overcoat
was in his trunk, which was strapped at the
rear of the stage. We were talking, when all
at once a norther came howling across the
country. My friend shouted to the driver to
unstrap his trunk, so as to allow him to unlock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it. The driver promptly obeyed, the
gentleman leaping out of the vehicle, hastily
unfastening his luggage, and bringing out the
extra garment. Only a few minutes were occupied,
and yet his teeth were chattering and
he was shivering and blue with cold while
hurriedly donning his greatcoat.</p>

<p>A young man in Dallas told me he was
standing on the opposite side of the street in
his shirt sleeves; a norther arrived; he struck
diagonally for his home on a dead run; that
home was less than two blocks off; he insisted
that if he had been delayed on the way by so
much as a fall he would have frozen to death;
but, somehow or other, I think he exaggerated
things.</p>

<p>But by the time Nick Ribsam had the fire
going, he was shivering. He gathered his
heavy blanket closely about him and sat down
near the blaze, but was still cold. The ponies
felt it. They shrunk against the rocks and
wherever they could find any shelter, and
looked dismal and wretched. No blankets
had been provided for them, but the luggage
of the entire party was at command and Nick’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sympathy led him to appropriate the articles
without a moment’s hesitation. It was a kind
act and did much for the comfort of the dumb
beasts.</p>

<p>What about Strubell and Lattin? They
must suffer, but they were acclimated and
would find some means of warding off the full
effort of the cutting winds, without the help
of extra clothing.</p>

<p>But poor Herbert! Nick fairly gasped as
he thought of him. He was in his ordinary
costume, and of course had not started a fire.
He would not be likely to do so, since he was
on his way to join Nick and would depend on
him for everything of that sort.</p>

<p>“Heaven save him,” prayed Nick, “but if
he doesn’t arrive soon he must perish. <i>Hurry,
Herbert!</i>” he called at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>In his anxiety, Nick started down the path
with the extra blanket flung over his arm,
while he was so swathed in his own that he
resembled an Indian chief, striding along the
trail.</p>

<p>Night had fully come, and the sky, which
had been quite clear during most of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was overcast, so that he could see but a short
distance in any direction. Still he hurried on,
confident every minute that the forms of Herbert
and Jill would loom to view in the darkness.</p>

<p>But rod after rod was passed, and they did
not appear. Suddenly Nick stooped down
and placed his ear against the earth.</p>

<p>“I hear his pony’s hoofs!” he exclaimed,
raising his head and peering forward, “but
why is he so long on the way?”</p>

<p>Applying his ear again, the startling fact
was evident: the sound of the horse’s hoofs
was fainter than before. The animal was
receding instead of approaching.</p>

<p>“Something has gone wrong with the poor
fellow, and what can I do to help him?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">CAUGHT FOUL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">NICK RIBSAM was partly right in his
supposition about his missing friend,
Herbert Watrous.</p>

<p class="pn">That young gentleman rode along the lower
trail, as confident as anyone could be that he
was right and Nick was wrong. He did not
press Jill, for the pony had done considerable
hard riding during the day, but he arrived at
the end of his brief journey a little in advance
of the other.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” he said at the moment of
catching sight of the pool of clear water,
which, like the spring, was slightly to the
right of the path; “there aren’t many brighter
boys than Nick, but he makes his mistake
once in a while, like other folks.”</p>

<p>And then, as his pony walked forward to
drink, his rider gave out the signal intended
to summon Nick to the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“He will feel cheap when he finds he is
wrong, but he is manly enough to own up to
it, and admit that some folks know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sitting astride of his animal while he was
helping himself to a drink, Herbert made good
use of his eyes. Just then he observed that,
though the pool resembled a natural spring, it
was not. It was fed by a stream pouring into
the upper portion, as large as that which
formed the outlet, while there was no bubbling
from the bottom.</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the astonished youth;
“it begins to look as if it wasn’t Nick that
had made a slip&mdash;hello!”</p>

<p>At that moment the call came ringing down
from the upper trail. The matter was settled.
Nick had struck the right spot, and all Herbert
could do was to ride back along the path
to the fork and join him.</p>

<p>He was on the point of starting back, when
it occurred to him that it might be possible to
shorten the distance by cutting across the neck
of land, as talked about before they parted.
The promise of being able to do so looked more
encouraging from below than above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Slipping down from the saddle, Herbert
began picking his way through the rough portion,
and advanced several rods before reaching
a section where a horse would find the travelling
difficult.</p>

<p>“He could make his way this far easily
enough,” he said, halting and looking back,
“but it doesn’t seem so easy further on.”</p>

<p>He advanced more carefully, for he was
beginning to doubt the feasibility of the plan.
It will be readily seen that while he was so
uncertain as to the best course, he was consuming
more time than he suspected. Night was
rapidly closing in, and he was still debating
what was best to do, when he noticed the
increasing cold.</p>

<p>“It’s the norther, sure enough!” he
exclaimed, starting back to mount his horse;
“a little late, but it’s getting there all the
same.”</p>

<p>In fact it “got there” with such emphasis
that, before Herbert could force his way to the
pool of water, lie thought he would freeze to
death. There was no need of answering the
signal of Nick, and, catching sight of the outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of what seemed a mass of rocks in the
darkness, he made for them, intent only on
securing shelter for the moment, or until the
cutting wind abated enough to allow him to
venture out to recover his horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the latter, who had had more
than one previous experience with northers,
was trying to help himself somewhat after the
same fashion as his master. Since the arctic
breath from the distant Rocky Mountains
came from the north, Jill began edging away
from it by taking the back trail, just as cattle
drift before a long continued and violent storm
of sleet and snow.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the pony held
any purpose of deserting his master. He had
never tried to do anything of the kind, and it
would be injustice to accuse him in the present
instance; but the instinct of self-preservation
was as strong in him as in any other animal,
and he saw no other way of lessening his sufferings
than by edging along the back trail.</p>

<p>When he reached the fork where the two
paths separated, he may have recalled his situation
and he may not. Be that as it may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it was too much to expect him to face about
and advance in the teeth of the norther, before
which he had retreated so far, unless he was
compelled to do so. No one was there to urge
him with spur, and instead, therefore, of turning
his course, he kept on.</p>

<p>He had moved so reluctantly to this point
that he did not reach it until Nick Ribsam
knelt down a short distance off and put his ear
to the ground. By this time, too, it probably
struck Jill that he was moving more slowly
than was wise. He therefore struck a quicker
gait, speedily passing beyond hearing in the
gloom, and leaving Nick puzzled, mystified,
and anxious beyond expression.</p>

<p>All this time, Herbert Watrous never
dreamed that his pony was steadily increasing
the distance between them. If he had known
it, he could have taken no steps to prevent the
mishap, for his whole mental and physical
energies were bent toward saving himself from
perishing with the fearful cold.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more fortunate
than his finding a small cavern. It was really
providential that he should stumble upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and he would have fared ill had he failed to
do so. It was of slight extent, being no more
than a dozen feet in depth, and of such narrow
compass that he bumped his head or struck his
limbs against the sides at every movement he
made.</p>

<p>Crouching in the furthest corner, he huddled
himself together as best he could, and concluded
there was hope of seeing the thing
through, provided it got no worse.</p>

<p>“If it drops another degree, I’m a goner!”
he muttered, as well as he could between his
chattering teeth. “I don’t see what’s the use
of having such weather as this in Texas, when
we can get all we want at the North Pole. It
beats anything I ever heard of in Maine; I’m
glad Nick has the blankets, for he must need
them.”</p>

<p>For fully two hours Herbert shrank in his
place, in the cavity among the rocks. During
most of that time, the wind moaned around
the front, as if seeking him out that it might
freeze his very marrow. The hardest thing
for him was to comprehend that he was
actually in Texas, where but a brief while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
before the temperature was like a poet’s
dream.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, which he comprehended
very clearly. If he stayed where
he was much longer, he would never come out
alive. He had not heard the second signal of
Nick, but was confident that he was able to
take care of himself, with his almost unlimited
supply of blankets.</p>

<p>There was one way of warming himself:
that was by vigorous exercise. That might
not answer perfectly, but it must help matters.
He, therefore, crept out of his refuge, and
began making his way down to the pool near
which he had left his pony. The gloom was
too profound for him to see anything distinctly,
and he came within a hair of pitching
headlong into the water, along the edges of
which a thin coating of ice had formed.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Herbert was gratified
to notice a decided rising of the temperature.
The relief was great, but not enough wholly to
relieve his sufferings. He called his pony by
name, but of course there was no response.</p>

<p>“He has been more sensible than me,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
concluded, “for he has gone to the spring,
where Nick has started a fire for him and
made them all comfortable while I suffered.”</p>

<p>The reader need not be reminded that once
again Herbert was off in his reckoning.</p>

<p>He spent the next ten minutes in jumping
about, swinging his arms, and going through
the most violent gymnastics possible. The
effect was good. His benumbed limbs became
supple, the chilled surface began glowing, and
a grateful warmth crept through his entire
system.</p>

<p>It would have been folly to try to reach Nick
by working across the neck of bowlders and
obstructions, and he started down the trail in
the direction taken by Jill, though he was a
long way behind him.</p>

<p>This required no little care, even though he
was following a distinctly marked trail. In
the darkness he received several severe bruises,
besides tumbling flat on his face more than
once. But he kept his wits about him, and
made sure that he did not pass the fork, where
it was necessary to turn off and follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
trail taken by Nick, and which had proven to
be the right one.</p>

<p>Here it was necessary to use still greater
care than before, for the route was strange to
him, and might contain dangerous pitfalls.</p>

<p>“Nick will wonder what’s become of me,”
he reflected, maintaining as lively a pace as he
dared, “but I hope he hasn’t worried&mdash;halloo!
that’s good!” he added, as he caught the
twinkle of a fire; “that’s where I will find the
good fellow, who has known enough to take
care of himself and the ponies, and would have
done the same with me if I hadn’t been so
foolish.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">HERBERT noticed, as he went forward,
that the fire was sinking so low as to
show that it had not been looked after for
some time. Backed against a bowlder near the
spring, it was well protected from the wind,
but had been fanned into a blaze that must
have diffused a good deal of warmth in all
directions.</p>

<p>The first mild surprise came to the youth
when, on coming close to the smouldering
camp fire, he failed to see Nick. He expected
to find him resting comfortably near at hand,
swathed in one of the thick blankets capable
of shutting out every kind of cold except that
of a norther, which will force its way through
almost anything.</p>

<p>Stepping forward into the light of the fire,
Herbert looked inquiringly around in the
gloom, and called the name of his friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
repeating it several times with increasing loudness,
but with no more result than in the first
instance. Then the youth started out to investigate
for himself.</p>

<p>The discovery that followed was startling.
Not only Nick Ribsam, but his horse, the two
pack animals and the pony belonging to Herbert,
were missing! They were nowhere in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The youth was knocked almost breathless.
He came back beside the smouldering fire and
tried to reason connectedly over the situation.</p>

<p>“This is ahead of everything yet,” he said
to himself; “it begins to look as if all actions
are tinged with mystery. Nick and I couldn’t
understand why Strubell and Lattin should
act as they did this afternoon, but I am not
half as much mystified over that as over this.
Nick and all the horses gone. What can it
mean?”</p>

<p>“All that is left me, besides my weapon,” he
added with grim feeling, “is my field glass,
but I don’t need that to see what a fix I’m in,
and yet I am more worried about Nick than
myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought he heard a footfall from the
direction of the fork of the trails. Grasping
his Winchester he moved silently back in the
gloom, where he could not be seen by any
lurking Indian or white enemy.</p>

<p>“It is Nick returning,” was his thought, as
he recognized the hoofs of an animal.</p>

<p>The next minute his own pony, saddled and
bridled, as when he last saw him, walked forward
in the firelight and uttered a faint
whinny of pleasure at sight of his master.</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you!” was the grateful
exclamation of Herbert as he met him and
patted his neck; “I feared you were gone for
good; but, Jill, how I wish you could talk
that you might tell me all about Nick and the
other horses.”</p>

<p>To say the least, the pony had behaved himself
in a singular fashion. I have told how he
was driven along by the norther until he passed
beyond the fork in the trails, Nick Ribsam
catching the faint footfalls as he applied his
ear to the ground, which told him the beast
was receding.</p>

<p>No doubt there crept into the brain of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
sagacious animal a conviction that he was not
doing precisely the right thing in wandering
away from the spot where his master had left
him, and where, of course, he expected to find
him on his return.</p>

<p>In addition, the norther, that had brought
about this breach of confidence, subsided to
that extent that it was no hardship to face it.
This subsidence, however, did not reach a
degree that suited Jill until he had drifted off
for a considerable while. Then he began edging
backward, and, possibly because he divined
the intentions of Herbert, he followed the main
trail until he joined his master at the camp
fire.</p>

<p>Among the many extraordinary incidents
which attended the tour of Nick and Herbert
through the Southwest, probably there was
none more remarkable than the action of the
pony Jill and the consequences flowing therefrom.
He drifted away from the scene of
several singular events and remained absent
until they were finished. Then he came back,
and had he been a little later or earlier, the
whole face of history might have been changed&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is, so far as it related to the youths I
have named.</p>

<p>Having regained his pony, Herbert was as
much perplexed as ever. It was an invaluable
piece of good fortune thus securing his
horse, for a person on the plains without a
good steed is in the situation of the sailor
without boat or ship on the ocean; but he was
totally at a loss how to proceed.</p>

<p>The most obvious course was to stay where
he was until morning, or until some kind of
knowledge came to him. The Texans had
promised to join him and Nick by daylight
and probably before, and it would not require
them long to decide upon the best line to follow.
If Nick had set out along the lower trail to
search for him, he must have learned of his
mistake before this; and, though it was
curious that the friends had not met, the
younger ought to return to his own camp
fire whither he had summoned Herbert hours
before.</p>

<p>The disquieting factor in the situation was
the absence of the animals, and the return of
his own; for Herbert could not be expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
know all about the action of Jill in his
encounter with the norther.</p>

<p>He soon became satisfied that a long wait
was before him. Accordingly, the saddle and
bridle were removed from the pony, that he
might be free to crop the grass within reach,
while his owner spent considerable time in
gathering wood with which to keep the fire
going. There was only a small supply of fuel
on hand, and this work was necessary, therefore,
on his part.</p>

<p>The weather had moderated to the extent
that it was much the same as before the
norther swept through the hills. The blaze
was not needed, except for its aid in dispelling
the oppressive gloom.</p>

<p>Herbert was seated near the fire, and had
just looked at his watch and seen that it was
past eleven o’clock, when he was alarmed by
several discharges of rifles. They were dull,
but loud enough to prevent any mistake as to
their nature. The direction, too, was easily
recognized as being from the other side of the
ridge.</p>

<p>“Nick and I were right,” he said, listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with a rapidly beating heart; “Strubell and
Lattin are having a fight with the horse
thieves&mdash;there they go again!”</p>

<p>Two reports in rapid succession were heard,
and then came a third and fourth, followed
after an interval of several minutes by other
dropping shots. These were noticed, now and
then, during the next hour, after which, so far
as Herbert could judge, everything remained
still.</p>

<p>Beyond question, he was right in his belief
that a lively scrimmage had taken place between
Bell Rickard, Jim-John the half-breed,
and their companion on one side, and the
Texans on the other. As to the result, no one
could tell who was not present, until some one
of the participants was seen.</p>

<p>Though much disturbed by his fear that the
cowboys had suffered, a certain pleasure came
to Herbert at this proof of the genuine hostility
between his friends and the rogues. It
will be remembered that he had had troublesome
misgivings in this respect. He felt there
had been reason to doubt the honesty of
Strubell and Lattin, and that, despite appearances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
an understanding existed between them
and the criminals who were following them so
persistently.</p>

<p>The reports of the firearms disproved all
this and showed beyond question that the
Texans were good men, ready to defend their
property and the youths with them, no matter
how great the risks to themselves.</p>

<p>Herbert had decided to stay where he was
until morning or some news of his friends
reached him, and wait he did through the
almost endless night. Toward daylight, he
fell into a dreamful sleep, which lasted until
the sun was above the horizon. Then he
started up and stared around, a minute or two
passing before he could recall all the incidents
of the preceding night.</p>

<p>His horse had risen from the ground and
was cropping the grass; the fire had smouldered
to ashes, and the clear morning was
as balmy and pleasant as its predecessor.
Neither Nick nor the Texans were in sight;
but, determined to find out something for
himself, he hurriedly saddled and bridled his
pony and galloped down the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“They promised to be here before this,” he
said, referring to Strubell and Lattin; “and
they would have kept their word, if they had
the power to do so. One, and perhaps both,
have been killed, or so badly wounded that
they cannot leave the battle ground.”</p>

<p>At the forks, the plain was so open to the
westward that he reined up and raised his
field glass to his eye. He had detected moving
bodies in the distance, and the first view
through the telescope showed them with great
clearness.</p>

<p>A small party of horsemen were moving
northward, their animals on a walk. While
studying them closely, Herbert’s attention was
drawn to one in particular. He was riding on
the extreme right, so that he was the nearest
to him and was in plain sight.</p>

<p>A brief study of this figure left no doubt of
the astounding fact that he was no other than
the missing Nick Ribsam himself!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SOLITARY PURSUER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">HERBERT held his field glass to his eyes
for several minutes, while he carefully
studied the group of horsemen out upon the
plain. There were four of them, beside the
two pack animals, all apparently well mounted,
and the clear sunlight brought them into clear
relief. Their ponies were walking slowly, not
exactly north, but bearing a little to the west,
so that the general direction was the same
as that of our friends on their way to New
Mexico.</p>

<p>The horseman on the right was Nick Ribsam.
Although the distance was too great to
distinguish his features, the presence of the
pack horses settled the question and there was
no mistaking his personality: it was he beyond
all doubt.</p>

<p>“What can be the explanation of his presence
with them?” was the question which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
alarmed Herbert asked himself, as he lowered
his glass and gazed absently in the direction,
while he studied the most perplexing problem
that had yet presented itself.</p>

<p>He was impressed by the fact that there
were three horsemen besides his friend. That
was the number that made up the band
of Bell Rickard. What more likely than
that the three with Nick were the horse
thieves?</p>

<p>In the hours that had passed since they
were seen, far out on the plains to the eastward,
they possessed sufficient time to make
their way through the hills to this point.
Indeed, they could have done so after the
sounds of firing ceased on the other side of the
hills.</p>

<p>But this theory of necessity raised other
perplexing questions. If those three men
were the criminals, where were Strubell and
Lattin? Where had they been, while the
piece of treachery was pushed to a conclusion?
Was it supposable that they had remained
idle and permitted Nick’s most dangerous
enemy to get him in his power?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly not&mdash;<i>provided it was in their
power to prevent it</i>.</p>

<p>The inference could not be escaped by
Herbert that the cowboys had been put out
of the way by their enemies, and that, therefore,
no further help was to be expected from
them.</p>

<p>Other questions presented themselves, which
would have puzzled a more experienced frontiersman
than the young New Yorker.</p>

<p>He and Nick had discovered a second camp
fire the afternoon before, to the northward.
Who kindled that, and what was its significance?
Evidently it had some connection
with the Texans or the criminals, but nothing
could be learned to indicate its nature.</p>

<p>Were the continued absence and silence of
the cowboys explainable on any other theory
than their own overthrow?</p>

<p>These questions, however, were put out of
sight by the personal peril of Nick Ribsam,
and the anxiety of Herbert to do something
for him without delay.</p>

<p>His first inclination was to gallop back over
the trail to the point where he left Strubell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and Lattin the afternoon before, and tell
them what had taken place. They were the
only ones of whom aid could reasonably be
expected.</p>

<p>But it has been shown that he feared the
worst concerning them. Time was precious,
and to cross the ridge and return would take
a half hour, which might be fatal to any other
step toward helping Nick. This fear was
intensified by the discovery that the walk of
the ponies to the westward had become a gallop,
which was fast widening the gap between
them and the ridge, where the distressed Herbert
was trying to settle what he ought to do,
if indeed he could do anything, for his loved
friend.</p>

<p>“I will follow them,” was the conclusion
which he reached after briefly thinking over
every phase of the question; “I don’t know
that it will do Nick any good, but it’s just
what <i>he</i> would do if our situations were
changed.”</p>

<p>Herbert was well aware that in making this
important decision, the only possible hope&mdash;and
it was slight indeed&mdash;of doing anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for Nick was by using the utmost discretion.</p>

<p>One might well ask what chance he could
have against three veteran plainsmen, who
were without principle or honor. Had Herbert
himself been asked the question, he would
have found it hard to answer. It may be said
that something in the nature of a ransom suggested
itself, though he was too wise to build
much hope on that means.</p>

<p>The one thing clear in his mind was that he
must hide his pursuit, if he could do so, from
all knowledge of the abductors. If they possessed
a field glass, as he believed was likely,
they must have discerned him at the foot of
the hills, provided the instrument was turned
in that direction. Hopeful, however, that
they had not done so, he drew his pony behind
a sheltering rock, and held his gaze fixed on
the horsemen, who maintained their gallop,
which was fast taking them out of his natural
field of vision.</p>

<p>He waited until the fluttering specks were
barely perceptible to the unassisted eye, and
then decided to follow the trail a little way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the southward, before wheeling to the west.
He thought it less likely that he would be
noticed, if he left the hills at a point removed
from where he had been waiting so long, and
where, had the criminals observed him, they
would look for his reappearance.</p>

<p>He had ridden no more than a hundred
yards, when, to his astonishment, he came
upon the site of the strangers’ last encampment.
It was directly beside the trail, where
there was no water, but the smouldering camp
fire and the cropped grass showed that several
hours had been passed there. More important
than all to the solitary pursuer was the finding
of the remains of an antelope that had furnished
the party with a meal. The youth had
not eaten food since the preceding noon, and,
highly wrought as were his feelings, he was
faint and in need of nourishment. Enough
fragments were scattered about for him to
obtain all he wanted in that line, so long as he
was not over fastidious.</p>

<p>Since he was hungry and there was no saying
when he could secure another meal, Herbert
was wise in eating his fill. Then, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
he swung himself into the saddle, he looked
across the plain and failed to see the horsemen;
but the glass, being brought into play,
revealed them apparently in the very rim of
the horizon.</p>

<p>“Ah, they have changed their course!” he
exclaimed; “that looks as if they had no
instrument after all and think I am beyond
their sight.”</p>

<p>It will be remembered that beyond the level
stretch of country, another and loftier range
of hills showed against the clear sky. The
horsemen were moving toward them, and Herbert
believed it was with the purpose of misleading
him or anyone that undertook to
follow them. True, the trail left by them was
so marked that, once taken, it could be maintained
without trouble to the end; but, for
reasons already shown, they were warranted
in considering that improbable.</p>

<p>The pursuer, however, decided to take no
chances that he could avoid. Having started
from the encampment of the preceding night,
he was on their track from the beginning, and
he meant to maintain it to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how deceptive distance
is in the clear air of the plains. Objects that
appear but a few miles away prove to be two
and three times as far. Herbert Watrous had
been long enough in Texas to learn this
fact. The range that he had noticed the
afternoon before seemed to be within half
a day’s ride, but he was convinced it would
require brisk traveling to reach it by sunset.</p>

<p>Then, too, the plan he had fixed upon forced
him to keep a long way to the rear, so that, if
the horsemen struck the other range by set of
sun, the night would be well along before he
could come up with them. There was no
moon to help him, and this might interfere
with his programme.</p>

<p>But, as may be said, he had put his hand to
the plough and did not look back.</p>

<p>Contrary, however, to the maxim, this was
an unfortunate mistake on his part; for, had
he, after riding the major part of the distance,
turned in his saddle and surveyed the course
traversed, he would have made an important
discovery, and one, too, that must have had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
important bearing on the almost hopeless
enterprise in which he was engaged.</p>

<p>But Herbert’s interest was all in front.
Nick Ribsam was in the power of his enemies,
and possibly he could aid him, though common
sense told him that the chances were as ninety-nine
to one that he would end the business by
putting himself in the same hole. A party of
desperate men that were cunning enough to
make the sagacious Nick prisoner were not
likely to be annoyed by anything Herbert
Watrous could do to checkmate them; but
youth is ardent and hopeful, and none of these
things weakened the pursuit of the New
Yorker.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SECOND RANGE OF HILLS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">BUT while riding across the level plain,
Herbert Watrous did a good deal of
thinking, and strove hard to fix upon the
wisest course to benefit the missing Nick.</p>

<p>Now, as I have intimated, nothing could be
clearer than the foolhardiness of trying to
outwit the criminals, or to aid his friend
by his own shrewdness. They had made a
prisoner of the youth, who Herbert knew
was his superior in every respect, and could
well afford to laugh at the utmost he essayed
to do.</p>

<p>Without attempting to answer the many
questions that presented themselves, he confined
his speculation to one or two bearing
directly upon the important business on which
he was engaged.</p>

<p>Admitting that Bell Rickard, the crooked
dealer in horse-flesh, had made a prisoner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Nick Ribsam, it followed that he held no
intention of doing him immediate harm.
Had his anger been as deep and resentful as
supposed, he would have shot him down at
sight, instead of taking him on a long ride.
Herbert shuddered at the thought that possibly
he meant to prolong his suffering and
torture, as do the American Indians in the
case of their captives, and that his revenge
would be carried out that evening. This
theory, however, was so violent that it caused
the youth less worriment than would be supposed.
He could not believe that Rickard
held any such shocking purpose. This
brought Herbert back to his former belief that
the frugal criminal was managing things with
a view of forcing a ransom from the friends of
his prisoner. While he saw numerous objections
to the idea, he decided to act upon it.
He meant to ride straight into the camp of the
thieves, and demand their reason for what
they had done.</p>

<p>If Rickard would agree to release Nick for
a reasonable sum, Herbert would gladly pay
it. He had considerable money with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and, if that proved insufficient, he could give
him drafts that would be honored in San
Antonio, Santa Fé, or San Francisco. It will
be remembered that Mr. Watrous had liberally
provided for his son in this respect.</p>

<p>Should Rickard accept the proposition, he
would still hold the whip hand, in case he
chose to betray both boys; but it was idle to
speculate. Time enough to face the varying
conditions as they presented themselves.</p>

<p>By the time this decision crystallized in the
mind of Herbert, the afternoon was half gone,
and he had ridden a good many miles. He
had seen no water, and, though he allowed
Jill to rest himself by walking at times, yet he
forced him to the verge of imprudence. Both
he and his master were thirsty and hungry,
but had to wait a convenient season before
attending to their wants.</p>

<p>At intervals, he had raised his glass and
studied the party, well in advance, but, as he
was on their trail, this was not necessary, and
a couple of hours passed without his doing so.
He was so absorbed in his thoughts that he
rode at the easy, swinging gait which Jill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
could maintain for a long time without
fatigue, paying no attention to his surroundings.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far along, and he was
drawing near the ridge that had seemed so
near ever since starting, when he roused himself
with the thought that he must keep his
senses about him, and cease the speculating
and daydreaming in which he had indulged
so long.</p>

<p>His first natural act was to look ahead for
the horsemen, but the unaided eye could not
see them. The helpful field glass was then
levelled, and he scanned the base of the hills
from a point well to the south, along his front,
and a considerable way to the north, but was
surprised to observe nothing of them.</p>

<p>“They have ridden in among the hills,
where they are out of sight, but that will
make little difference, as long as I stick to
their trail&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He checked his utterance in dismay, for,
looking down at the ground, he discovered
that he was not on the track of the party at
all. While rapt in a brown study, his pony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
had left it, and the anxious eyes which scanned
the prairie on all sides failed to detect the
first imprint of a horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a pretty pass!” he exclaimed
impatiently, as he reined up; “I left it to you,
Jill, not doubting that you would attend to
business; but, after all, it was my own
fault.”</p>

<p>Reflection, however, convinced him that the
case was not so bad after all. He could not
be far astray, and he decided to press on
toward the hills, and gallop along their base,
until he struck the missing trail.</p>

<p>That which caused him anxiety was the lateness
of the hour. The top of the ridge already
shut the sun from sight, and, ere long, night
would close over the scene, so obscuring the
footprints that further search must be hopeless.</p>

<p>It was this fact which caused him to touch
his spur sharply against the side of Jill, and
force him to a pace that he would not have
done in his tired condition, but for the urgency
of the case.</p>

<p>Jill responded gamely to the demand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
galloping with a speed that caused the still
wind to whistle by the rider’s face. The hills
were so close that a half hour carried him to
the base, and he once more brought the animal
down to a walk.</p>

<p>It was now a question whether he was too
far north or too far to the south of the point
of entrance by the party in advance. If he
should err, there was not enough daylight remaining
to correct the mistake; he would of
necessity be forced to wait until morning
before going on.</p>

<p>Since he had to guess at it, he acted on the
theory that he had struck the ridge to the
south. He therefore wheeled his pony to
the right, and touched him into a leisurely
canter, while he kept his eyes fixed on the
ground, as it swept under the hoofs of the
animal.</p>

<p>It was certainly remarkable that Herbert’s
thoughts remained so fixed upon what was in
front that he gave little or no attention to the
rear. Once, it is true, he glanced back over
the long space ridden during the day, and
noted that the ridge, which had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
scene of his stirring experience of the previous
night, was fast fading from sight; but the
survey was so brief and hasty that it failed to
take in an important feature in which he was
directly concerned.</p>

<p>Better fortune attended his search than he
anticipated, for he had ridden only a little
way when he struck the footprints of the
horses. It was still so light that he could
readily detect them without dismounting, but
that there should be no mistake, he slipped
from the saddle, and, holding the bridle in one
hand, walked several rods, carefully studying
the marks in the earth.</p>

<p>He was right. It was easy to see that
six horses had passed that way but a short
time before. Two of them must have been
the pack animals, while the others included
Nick Ribsam’s Jack, and the three belonging
to Bell Rickard and his two companions.</p>

<p>Their course along the eastern base of the
hills showed the riders were searching for a
favorable point of entrance. This looked as if
the party was not fully familiar with the section,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
though it was by no means certain this
was so.</p>

<p>Herbert began to feel misgivings, as he
observed the twilight deepening into darkness,
while the trail still kept the same course,
varying a little now and then to the right or
left with the changing course of the elevation.</p>

<p>By and by, the gloom became so pronounced
that he drew his pony down to a walk, and,
leaning over the saddle, studied the ground
with the closest scrutiny. It was not long
before this proved insufficient and he again
dismounted.</p>

<p>“It makes slow work,” he said, “but it is
sure&mdash;well, I’ll be hanged!”</p>

<p>Again there were no footprints before him!
The ground showed not the least impression
when he struck a match and stooped over.</p>

<p>“We can’t be far off the track, Jill; we
must now take the back trail, as the hunters
say.”</p>

<p>Holding the bridle in his left hand, he
began carefully retracing his steps; but,
instead of hunting for the path, he looked for
the point where it had turned in among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
hills. This must be close at hand, for the
footprints were lost only a short time before.</p>

<p>He had advanced a little more than a hundred
yards, when he observed an opening
among the stunted vegetation and bowlders
wide enough to allow a horse to pass through
without trouble.</p>

<p>“This looks as if it might be the right
place,” he said, stopping and scrutinizing it;
“we’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>Another lucifer was called into play. He
bent down, holding it before his head; and,
as the tiny flame spread, he uttered an exclamation
of delight. He had recovered the
trail!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN THE RAVINE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE discovery that he was so near the
party caused Herbert’s heart to beat
faster than usual. He felt the need of prudence
and caution at every step, since he could
not know whether Rickard was aware of his
pursuit. It might be that the fellow had discovered
it and laid an ambush for him.</p>

<p>But, in accordance with his previous resolution,
he pushed on, leading his pony by the
bridle, until he had penetrated a number of
rods among the hills, when he once more
paused.</p>

<p>He was struck by the resemblance between
the ridge and the one where he had spent the
previous night. The curious exception, however,
was that the trail that he was following
was without any ascent. Thus it was that,
when he stopped, he found the rocks and
trees rising on either hand, as if he was entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a cañon or deep ravine. The ground
showed no grass, but was so gravelly under his
feet, and so filled with stones and hollows, that
he was sure a torrent or river, at some time or
other, had forced its way over the bed.</p>

<p>That which checked him abruptly was his
stepping into a pool of water, into which one
foot sank to the knee. He hastily drew back,
with a slight gasp caused by its coolness, and
then, observing nothing distinctly in the
gloom, struck a match.</p>

<p>The air was as still as in a vault, and it was
unnecessary to shade the little blaze which he
held in front and above his head.</p>

<p>The pool was so narrow that he could easily
leap to the other side. It was clear, and Jill
showed his appreciation of the boon by thrusting
his nose into it and drinking his fill. Herbert
himself was thirsty enough to lie down on
his face and do the same.</p>

<p>He found that the ravine which he had
entered had a varying width of a dozen to fifty
feet, with precipitous sides, composed of such
a mass of jagged and projecting rocks that it
was easy to climb out of it from any point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Not a particle of grass was visible, though
possibly it was to be found further on.</p>

<p>Herbert’s conclusion was that the ravine cut
through the hills, and had been used by
Rickard and his party to reach the other side.
Whether he was correct or not remained to be
learned.</p>

<p>It struck him, however, as imprudent to
take his pony further. The sound of his hoofs
were quite certain to betray him to anyone on
the watch, while the youth himself could steal
forward without noise. The light of the burning
match had revealed a gnarled root projecting
from the side of the ravine. He carefully
tied the bridle to this, for the place was so
unique in its way that he was resolved to take
no chances of Jill going astray. He would lose
nothing by the detention, because, as has been
shown, food was unobtainable and his master
did not expect to be long absent.</p>

<p>Pausing a minute to make sure his pony was
securely fastened, Herbert pushed into the
ravine, on the alert for the first sign of the
criminals and their prisoner. It was an impressive
situation, and, mindful of his slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
mishap, he moved with great care, occasionally
burning a match when afraid of a misstep.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after leaving his horse, he
turned an abrupt bend in the ravine and was
startled by observing the light of a camp fire.
It was only a little way ahead, and directly in
front, so that, had he continued his walk
without variation, he must have stepped into
the blaze itself.</p>

<p>The gorge, which was comparatively narrow
up to this point, expanded into a width of
fully a hundred yards, in the middle of which
a large fire had been kindled, that lit up the
surrounding gloom, and threw a faint illumination
almost to the feet of Herbert, who stood
silently studying it.</p>

<p>That the site was well chosen was proven by
the gleam of another pool of water, much
larger than the former, while a patch of green
grass extended from the fire beyond until lost
in the darkness.</p>

<p>The first glance at the camp was with the
conviction that he had overtaken the party he
was after, but the second look raised strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
doubts in his mind, for he failed to observe
that which until that moment he was confident
of seeing.</p>

<p>The party that he had followed so far across
the prairie, consisted of four horsemen, one of
whom was Nick Ribsam, but only two were
now in sight, and neither was the lad. Nor
were the pack horses visible.</p>

<p>The reader must not forget that Herbert was
asleep during Bell Rickard’s forced visit to
camp the night before and a long distance had
separated the two until now. It was impossible,
therefore, for him to know whether either
of the parties before him was that worthy or
not.</p>

<p>The light of the fire was sufficiently strong
to bring out in relief the two horses, grazing
on the luxuriant patch of grass, but, as I have
said, no other animals were in sight.</p>

<p>One man was sitting on a stone near the fire,
smoking a pipe, while the other stood in front
of him, whittling a stick in the indifferent
fashion that a person shows when his thoughts
are otherwise occupied. He faced the one
sitting on the bowlder, and the murmur of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
their voices was heard, as they talked, though
no words were intelligible.</p>

<p>They were dressed in cowboy fashion, with
their broad-brimmed hats, long hair, hickory
shirts, and slouchy trousers tucked in their
boot tops, not forgetting the belt around the
waist for cartridges and pistols.</p>

<p>Herbert judged they were white men, though
it was easy to be mistaken, since they might
have been of mixed blood without its being
betrayed in the firelight. He fancied one was
the notorious horse thief, Belden Rickard, and
the other the equally well-known half-breed,
Jim-John; but this had to remain conjecture
until someone confirmed or disproved it.</p>

<p>The bitter disappointment was his failure to
see Nick, who he was confident of overtaking
at the first camp reached. The only theory by
which he could explain matters was that the
party had divided, and one of the men had
pushed on with Nick as his companion. If this
were so, that one must have been Rickard.
Possibly he feared pursuit, and was using the
darkness to get further on with the pack
horses, which could not travel as fast as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
others. This might be readily done, a rendezvous
having been agreed upon beforehand.</p>

<p>Herbert remained, viewing the fire, for a
time, thinking it possible that Nick and the
other man might put in an appearance, but as
the minutes passed, he was confirmed in the
belief named.</p>

<p>He determined to continue the hunt until
he learned the truth. The expansion of the
ravine where the fire had been kindled was so
great that he could readily pass it without
detection, but it would hardly do to venture
upon so uncertain a journey on foot, when
there was urgent need of a horse.</p>

<p>His plan, therefore, was to return for his
pony and try to flank the camp, by leading
him past. If he were discovered and challenged,
he would boldly advance and make his
business known, demanding that he be told
where he could find his missing friend.</p>

<p>He took a parting look at the couple in
whom he was so interested. They held the
same positions as before, one sitting on the
stone smoking, and the other standing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
front, slowly whittling, while they discussed
some matter in which neither seemed to feel
a very deep interest.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained by waiting, and
Herbert started back to get his horse. He had
fixed the points so well in mind, that, when
he supposed he was near the pool and ignited
a match, he saw he was on the edge of it. He
leaped lightly across, and, with the tiny flame
still in his hand, walked to where his pony
was tied a short time before.</p>

<p>Jill was gone! Since he could not have
freed himself, someone had removed him.</p>

<p>While Herbert stood silent and dismayed,
he caught the sound of a footfall, accompanied
by a chuckle of triumph.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">REINFORCEMENTS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">HERBERT WATROUS was dumbfounded.
He had stolen up the ravine and spent
some time in studying the campfire and the
two strangers, and now, on his return to where
his pony had been tied, the animal was gone.
While he was acting the spy, the same trick
had been successfully played on him.</p>

<p>But he roused quickly, and running a few
steps in the direction of the retreating horse
and his captor, called:</p>

<p>“Stop, or I’ll shoot! You can’t steal my
animal!”</p>

<p>It was an idle threat, for, in the gloom, he
only knew the direction taken by the man and
beast, and his shot, therefore, must have been
at random.</p>

<p>“Shoot if you want to,” was the defiant
reply; “but the flash of your gun will give us
the show to drop <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely he had heard <i>that</i> voice before.</p>

<p>“Strubell, is that you?” he called, still
hurrying forward, but with his weapon lowered.</p>

<p>Two persons now laughed, and the well-known
tones of the Texan called back:</p>

<p>“You’ll have to practise a while, young
man, before you learn how to trail Indians
and horse thieves.”</p>

<p>Delighted beyond measure, Herbert quickly
joined the friends, whom he had hardly
expected to meet again.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you were killed,” said he,
“and had no idea you were near me. Where
did you come from?”</p>

<p>“We have been following you most of the
day,” said Strubell, “but your horse went so
fast we couldn’t overtake you, and, when
you slowed him down, we concluded to let you
go ahead, while we learned what you were
driving at.”</p>

<p>“When you are at this business,” added
Lattin, “you want to keep an eye to the rear
as well as to the front.”</p>

<p>The Texans had their own ponies with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and, so far as could be judged in the gloom,
were suffering no ill effect from their sharp
brush with their enemies the night before.</p>

<p>“Why did you take my horse?” asked
Herbert.</p>

<p>“We wanted to give you a little scare, but
you came back sooner than we expected. I
followed after you, and, while you were viewing
the camp fire, I did the same. I walked in
front of you on the return, but your Jill was
tied so fast that it took me longer than I
expected to unfasten him.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Belden at the camp up the
ravine?”</p>

<p>“No; and you didn’t either, for he isn’t
there.”</p>

<p>“Who are those fellows?”</p>

<p>“One is Jim-John the half breed, and the
other a fellow named Brindage&mdash;Homer Brindage,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“They belong to Rickard’s gang?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;two worse scamps never went unhanged;
I was afraid you were going forward
to talk with them, and stood ready to stop
you, if you made the start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, that’s exactly what I would have
done, if Nick had been with them,” said the
surprised Herbert; “would they have harmed
me?”</p>

<p>“You would have found out mighty sudden;
they are the kind that shoot first, and
inquire afterward whether there was any
reason for their haste.”</p>

<p>While the brief conversation was going on,
Strubell remounted his horse and the lad did
the same. Lattin had been in the saddle from
the first.</p>

<p>“You had a fight with them last night?”</p>

<p>“How did you know that?” asked Lattin.</p>

<p>“I heard the sounds of your guns as well as
theirs.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” replied the Texan, “we
didn’t have any scrimmage with them.”</p>

<p>“But there was plenty of firing.”</p>

<p>“Nobody denies <i>that</i>, but I’m tellin’ you
the truth, when I say we haven’t traded a
single shot with Bell Rickard or any of his
men.”</p>

<p>Since the Texan had made this remark,
Herbert expected he would follow it with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
explanation of the previous night’s experience.
He did not deny that there had been a fight,
only that Rickard and his men were not in
it. With whom, therefore, were their shots
exchanged?</p>

<p>Both Strubell and Lattin showed the same
annoying reticence about certain matters that
they had displayed more than once before.
Neither offered a reply to the question that
was asked by Herbert’s expressive silence,
which lasted for some moments.</p>

<p>A touch of impatience disturbed the youth.
He felt like Nick when similarly annoyed.
If they chose to affect so much mystery, he
was not the one to gratify them by showing
curiosity.</p>

<p>But a more important subject filled his
mind. The fate of Nick Ribsam outweighed
everything else, and on that he was not to be
denied all the information they could furnish.
Their help was needed and that without
delay.</p>

<p>“From what you have said, Strubell, there
is no doubt that Rickard has ridden away
with Nick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“I agree with you that far.”</p>

<p>“Where has he gone?”</p>

<p>“How can you expect me to know any more
about that than you?”</p>

<p>“But you <i>do</i> know more. What do you
suppose?”</p>

<p>“They are pushing toward New Mexico.”</p>

<p>“But that is hundreds of miles off.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t hinder their riding that way
more than it does us; they may never get
there, but I suspect they are aiming for that
country.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe Rickard is an enemy of
Nick?”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of it; that little affair
last night, which he must have explained to
you, has stirred up all the ugliness in Bell’s
nature, and he is full of it.”</p>

<p>“What do you think he means to do with
Nick?”</p>

<p>“I would like to answer that question,”
said Strubell, who evidently sympathized with
his young friend; “but I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Do you fear he means to kill him?”</p>

<p>“I <i>hope</i> not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens,” exclaimed the agonized Herbert,
“and are we to sit here and allow such
a crime to be committed?”</p>

<p>“We are going to do our best to prevent it,”
was the response of Lattin, which struck fire
in the hearts of the others.</p>

<p>“Yes,” spoke Strubell again, “that’s what
we’re here for; but before going further,
I want you to tell me what took place after
you left us yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you all, though most of it.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Herbert gave his experience with
the norther, when for a while he believed he
was doomed to freeze to death, ending with
his search for Nick and the discovery, through
the aid of his field glass, that he was riding
away in company with Rickard and his companions.
He had followed the party, doubting
whether he could do anything to help him,
but determined not to stay behind while Nick
was in peril.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Strubell, who, like Lattin,
listened attentively to the story, “you must
understand that we shall never let up till we
have straightened out this matter. Rickard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
has started toward New Mexico, and he means
to get there with the boy; the two are riding
hard at this minute and will press their horses
to the utmost.”</p>

<p>“But what is their purpose?” asked the
mystified Herbert.</p>

<p>“What is to be gained by puzzling our
heads over the meaning of things, when we
have the things themselves to deal with? I
have my suspicion of what Bell is driving at,
but I must get a little further along before I
say what it is. Lattin disagrees with me, and
a fellow doesn’t like to find he’s mistaken.
Let that go while we bend all our energies toward
righting the wrong.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me as strange that if Rickard is
in such haste, he should take the pack horses
with him.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“But they are not in camp,” said Herbert.</p>

<p>“No; he has taken them to some point not
far off, probably on the other side of the hills,
where they will be left for Brindage and Jim-John
to take care of. You understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
object of this,” the Texan hastened to add;
“they want to give the impression that they
are going slow, as they would have to do if
they kept the pack animals with them. That
is to throw dust in the eyes of Nick’s friends;
but you can depend upon it that it is not far
from camp that they have left them, and they
are now devoting themselves to speed. You
know that pony of your friend is as fleet as
any in this crowd.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of that; Nick is a good
judge of horses, and he studied him closely in
San Antonio before buying him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bell has had so many dealings in the
same line that you can make up your mind,
when he trusts his worthless life on the back
of an animal, that creature must know something
about grabbing ground.”</p>

<p>“That being so, tell me what your plan is,
Strubell.”</p>

<p>“Now it happens that Baker and I know
a little more about this part of the country
than Bell and his folks, though this isn’t the
first time they have traveled through it; they
think this ravine is the only pass through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hills, for a long distance, but there’s where
they make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But what of that?”</p>

<p>“We’ll take a ticket over the new route.”</p>

<p>This odd remark caused a laugh from Lattin,
who, unlike Herbert, caught its whole significance.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PURSUIT.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">MEN trained in the profession of the cowboys
think and act quickly. Within a
half hour following their meeting with Herbert
Watrous, the party were travelling the other
way, and shortly after emerged from the
hills, where the ground was perfectly level,
and advantage could be taken of the faint
moonlight which would soon aid them.</p>

<p>As soon as they were fairly out in the open
country, the Texans halted and sat motionless
for a moment. They were listening for sounds
which they heard not. Then Lattin slipped
from the saddle and held his ear for a full
minute pressed flat against the earth.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he remarked, swinging
himself over the back of his pony. The three
broke into a moderate gallop, riding almost
abreast, for there was abundant room for them
to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about a mile from where the last
change of direction took place that Strubell
drew his horse down to a walk and edged in
as close as he could to the hills, his companions,
of course, doing the same. It was
apparent that he was looking for the “new
route” that had been spoken of. Herbert did
all he could to aid, but when an abrupt change
was made he saw no cause for it.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason why so few know about
this,” explained the elder Texan, after stating
that they had struck the right spot; “if it
was plain enough to be seen miles off, Bell
would have known all about it.”</p>

<p>“Ard and me found it out by accident,”
added Lattin; “you observe how you turn
here, just as if you was passing behind a door,
before you hit the pass: that door hides it
from the sight of anyone out on the prairie.”</p>

<p>The peculiar conformation had been noticed
by Herbert, who replied that he could not
have noticed it at noonday.</p>

<p>“The queerest thing,” added Lattin, “is
that it’s just the same on the other side; if it
wasn’t, the pass would have been found from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that direction; me and Ard was chasin’ a
couple of Kioways one day that had stolen a
horse, when they dodged in here and gave us
the slip; that’s the way we hit it.”</p>

<p>An expert engineer could not have constructed
a finer cut through the ridge&mdash;that is,
for the present purpose. At no place was it
more than a hundred or less than fifty feet in
width, and the ground was so level that, had
they chosen, their horses might have galloped
the whole distance. There was little doubt
that the ridge had been broken apart at this
point by some terrific convulsion of nature,
the opposite sides corresponding so perfectly
that they would have dovetailed, could they
have been pushed together.</p>

<p>This being the fact, a brief time only
elapsed, when the three horsemen, whose sole
purpose now was to overtake the party that
was making off with Nick Ribsam, rode out
upon the open plain beyond.</p>

<p>Here was another brief halt, while the
younger Texan held his ear against the earth,
the other neither moving nor speaking. He
remained in his prone posture so long that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was evident he had detected something. He
must have caught a suspicious sound and was
trying to locate it.</p>

<p>“It’s right ahead,” he said, as he once
more climbed into the saddle, “and not fur
off.”</p>

<p>Since the movements were now based on the
discovery of the younger cowboy, the elder
dropped slightly back and joined Herbert as
an intimation that Lattin had become the
leader.</p>

<p>The latter kept his pony on a walk, and the
youth was close enough to him to observe that
he frequently turned his head in different
directions, showing that he was looking and
listening with the utmost care. All at once
he drew rein and the others halted by his
side.</p>

<p>“<i>Sh!</i> you hear ‘em,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Herbert noticed the stamp of a horse, as he
judged it to be, which could not have been far
in advance, though the night was so still that
a slight sound could be heard a long way. He
was tempted to ask whether it was not true
that if they could discover others close by, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
strangers had the same chance of learning
about them, but he was sure his friends understood
themselves too well to commit a blunder
which <i>he</i> would detect.</p>

<p>Without another word between the men the
younger let himself silently to the ground and
moved forward in the gloom. It seemed to
the youth that he showed rashness by this act,
for, instead of crouching over and stealing
along, step by step, he remained erect and
walked with his ordinary gait, except perhaps
he lifted and set down his feet more lightly.</p>

<p>It need not be said, however, that Baker
Lattin understood what he was doing, and,
when at the end of a few minutes he came
back, he brought the very news which Strubell
expected and which confirmed the theory
formed by the cowboys.</p>

<p>The three pack horses belonging to the
Americans were less than two hundred yards
distant. A couple were lying down while the
third was cropping the grass. No person was
nearer than the owners, so that it was proven
that they had been left there by Bell Rickard
and his companion to be picked up by Jim-John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and Brindage, who were to follow them
at a more leisurely pace.</p>

<p>The animals were not picketed, for they
were not likely to wander beyond easy reach
during the few hours that must elapse before
the rear guard could come up with them.
Their loads had been placed on the ground and
their bridles removed, so that they were free
to wander whither they chose.</p>

<p>The tidings were pleasing to our friends, who
were thus given the means of procuring what
they were sure to need before reaching the end
of their journey. Strubell brought forth the
blankets, extra suits for stormy weather, and
a goodly number of articles that insured comfort
for a good while to come.</p>

<p>It seemed odd that after recovering their
animals and property the Texans should
coolly turn them over to the thieves, but the
reader will see that it was the only thing to be
done. Rickard and Slidham had abandoned
them for the sake of speed, and for their pursuers
to take them up would be to handicap
themselves in the same fatal fashion.</p>

<p>The fugitives, as they may be called, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
got what they wanted from the pack horses,
and, when Strubell and Lattin did the same,
the loads were much lightened.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, without the slightest
hesitation that, after procuring their supplies,
our friends resumed their advance, leaving the
couple among the hills to explain by what
means the Texans had flanked them.</p>

<p>Strubell had hopes of overtaking Rickard
and Slidham before daylight, his belief being
that they would go into camp after riding
a number of miles. They had been in the
saddle so continuously during the last few
days, it would seem they ought to need rest as
much as their animals, but as the darkness
wore on without sight or sound of them, he
and Lattin agreed that the scamps were pushing
their horses to the utmost.</p>

<p>The pursuers were also pressing their animals
hard, and to a higher degree than they
would have done under other circumstances,
but the Texans showed an eagerness to reach
the other party that caused Herbert alarm.
He was certain there must be a cause for this
haste which they refused to explain to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>At long intervals one of the men resorted to
the usual test of placing his ear to the ground
with the hope of catching the sounds of footsteps.
Once he stated that he heard something
of the kind, and for a half hour they believed
they were coming up with the company
in front. It proved, however, that some kind
of animals were moving across the country
that were not likely to be those they were
seeking.</p>

<p>To settle the question the pursuit was forced,
and they overtook a couple of mavericks or
stray cattle. One of them was turned to
account, for Strubell shot it, and the party
went into camp.</p>

<p>It was high time they did so, for their ponies
were worn out and they themselves were tired
and sleepy. Enough fuel was found to start a
fire, over which a good meal was prepared,
sufficient being cooked and laid aside to allow
them to keep up the pursuit for a couple of
days without stopping for food.</p>

<p>The fear of Herbert Watrous was that a
mistake had been made by his friends who
had wandered from the trail, but when daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
dawned, and the Texans made an investigation,
they found they were right. Rickard
and Slidham were following the very course
named by them&mdash;that is, in the direction of
New Mexico.</p>

<p>“It looks as if it’s going to be a long chase,”
said Strubell; “but unless something unexpected
happens we shall win.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ACROSS THE BORDER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NOW came several days’ experience, so
similar in its main features that it is
not worth while to describe it in detail.</p>

<p>The Texans and Herbert Watrous pushed
their ponies to the verge of prudence; but
though the skill of the cowboys saved them
from going astray, and there never was any
danger of losing the trail of the fugitives, they
failed to catch sight of them during that
period.</p>

<p>They knew that Nick Ribsam rode a horse
fully the equal, if not the superior, of those
following him, and it was shown that Bell
Rickard and Harman Slidham were well
mounted. It was easy, therefore, for the three
to cover the same ground as their pursuers,
and, having as good a start, there was little
prospect of the parties gaining sight of each
other until those in advance chose to permit it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert Watrous will never forget that long
ride through Western Texas. Had he not
undergone a severe preparation he never
could have stood it, for it seemed to him that
he was in the saddle all the time, except
when stretched on the earth asleep. Jill, his
faithful pony, developed astonishing endurance,
but though the Texans got everything
possible out of the animals, they were too
prudent to force them to a killing pace; all
stood it well.</p>

<p>During that extended ride many streams
were crossed. One of them was the North
Fork of the Concho, properly the Colorado,
on which the capital of Texas stands. Although
at certain seasons this becomes a raging
torrent, the horses forded it from bank to
bank without once losing their feet. Indeed,
only for a few paces did the water touch the
stirrups of the riders.</p>

<p>There were other banks, separated by hundreds
of feet, down which they rode into deep
beds, where the signs showed the streams ran
full at certain times with an enormous volume
of water, but, like the current of the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Rio Grande, they seemed dried up. Here and
there were muddy pools, connected by tiny
threads of water, which hardly moved, while
elevations of the beds were met midway between
the shores, where the hoofs of their
horses actually stirred the dust.</p>

<p>In some portions of Texas the rise and
subsidence of the streams are as sudden as
those of Central Australia. At none of the
numerous crossings were our friends obliged to
swim their animals.</p>

<p>On the third day they were checked by a
norther, which caught them in the middle of
the plain, where nothing in the nature of a
shelter was available. But the Texans met the
crisis in an odd way.</p>

<p>First blanketing their ponies, they scooped
out small, circular holes in the ground, into
which they placed dried buffalo chips, and
dried blades of grass. When these were
fairly burning they folded their blankets
about their bodies so as to envelop their heads,
and then sat over the openings, allowing
enough space to save the fires from being
smothered. While the situation had its discomforts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it afforded a grateful degree of
warmth, which none enjoyed more than Herbert,
who could not help laughing at the
comical figures they made.</p>

<p>The norther, which fortunately did not last
long, was followed by a cold, drizzling rain,
which would have been uncomfortable to the
last degree but for the slickers of oiled linen
that had been provided for such emergencies.
The Texans, when they overtook the pack
animals, made certain that these garments
were secured, for it was inevitable that the
long ride before them should be marked by
occasional bad weather.</p>

<p>It was impossible to obtain good camping
grounds at all times, though the party did
not often suffer in this respect. While now
and then they went a day with only a single
meal, it cannot be said they actually suffered;
but the main purpose of the pursuers was
speed, and they were exasperated to find how
cleverly Rickard held his own. Not only
that, but there was reason to fear he was drawing
away from them. It was impossible, even
with the wonderful woodcraft of the pursuers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to make sure of this, for several hours cannot
show a perceptible difference in the trail of
three horsemen; but the Texans insisted that
there was greater space between them than at
the hour of opening the pursuit.</p>

<p>Since it was not believed that Rickard had
a field glass with him, the pursuers would
have gained a great advantage could they
have got nigh enough to see him, which was
the very thing they were unable to do.</p>

<p>I must not forget to make known one
important fact. You will remember the real
cause of Herbert Watrous’ journey across
Texas, which was to regain the health that
was seriously threatened by his bad habits
and rapid growth. While he received vast
benefit from breathing the pure air of the
Southwest, it was his forced march, as it may
be called, to New Mexico that did the splendid
work for him.</p>

<p>The continuous exercise, the crystalline
atmosphere, the deep, refreshing sleep, the
abstention from tobacco, nourishing food
(which, though only partially cooked and
eaten at long intervals, was the very best diet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
he could have obtained), in short the “roughing
it,” in the truest sense, was the true
“elixir of life,” and wrought a change in the
young man which, could his parents have
witnessed, they would have pronounced marvellous.</p>

<p>The sickly complexion was succeeded by a
ruddy brown, the effect of the wind, storms,
and sun; his shoulders straightened, his
slight, hacking cough vanished, and he felt
every morning, noon, and night that he was
gaining strength and health.</p>

<p>It has been said that no perfectly healthy
person can suffer depression of spirits for a
long time. Nature will rebound and lift him
above the gloom. Herbert Watrous wondered
more than once, while riding across the
prairie, or lying upon the grass, or springing
into the saddle in the morning, that he should
be so buoyant and hopeful when the youth
whom he loved best in all the world was in
peril of his life. He reproved himself that he
should feel thus, but, all the same, he could
not help it.</p>

<p>This lightness of spirits was not wholly due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to his rapidly improving health, but to the
fact that he was convinced there was a growing
reason to hope for the best. Whatever
the vicious Rickard might intend to do with
Nick Ribsam in the way of revenge, it was
clear his instant taking off did not form a part
of the scheme. The fact that, as the day
passed, Nick still kept his place among the
living, was good ground for hoping that he
would continue to do so indefinitely. Better
still, Strubell and Lattin agreed with him,
though neither was as sanguine as Herbert
himself.</p>

<p>There came one of those bright, perfect
days, when the sunshine seemed more golden,
the air clearer, and the sky bluer than is ever
seen elsewhere. Herbert noticed that his
companions were unusually interested in the
surrounding scenery. The prairie was mostly
of the rolling kind, though not to a marked
degree, and the grass was so plentiful and
succulent that the grazing could not have been
improved. They had forded a small stream,
and, gazing in any direction, nothing but the
same apparently endless plain greeted the eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Not a hill or mountain range was perceived in
any portion of the horizon.</p>

<p>“Herbert,” said Strubell, looking across
from his saddle, “in what part of the world
do you suppose we are?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the youth, surprised by
the question, “we must be well advanced into
Western Texas.”</p>

<p>“We are in New Mexico,” said the Texan,
with a smile, “and have been there for twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<p>“That’s good news, though I was expecting
it before long.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure of the exact spot where we
crossed the border, but it took place yesterday;
we are beyond the twenty-sixth meridian,
with the Sand Hills far to the east of us,
and north of the thirty-second parallel.”</p>

<p>“And how much further to the ranch?”</p>

<p>“The Pecos is less than fifty miles away,
and just on the other side of that is Mr. Lord’s
ranch. Hello!” he added, quickly bringing
his glass to his eyes; “we have seen a few
Indians, but, if I am not mistaken, yonder
comes a white man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Herbert was quick to bring his glass into
use, and instantly saw that his friend was
right. An individual was drawing near who
was destined to play an important part in the
stirring incidents at hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A RELIC OF OTHER DAYS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I MUST not omit to say that during the days
occupied in the long ride toward the northwest,
our friends saw Indians more than once.
They were generally straggling parties, who
viewed the three horsemen with as much
curiosity as our friends studied them. They
were either Comanches or Kioways, though
the hunting grounds of the latter were far to
the eastward. Close to the New Mexican
boundary they observed a half dozen warriors,
who the Texans said were Apaches. They
followed the whites for one afternoon, discharging
their guns from a distance, and more
than once seemed on the point of attacking
them; but a shot from Lattin wounded a
dusky raider badly, after which all drew off
and were seen no more.</p>

<p>The sight of a white man riding toward
them, with the evident purpose of a meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
centred the interest of the three on him. He
was mounted on a wiry “plug,” and as he
drew near was seen to be one of those individuals
occasionally met in the wildest parts of
the great West a generation ago. He belonged
to the trappers and hunters, who, leaving the
confines of civilization at the close of the
summer season, spent the severe winters in
trapping beavers, otters, and other fur-bearing
animals. They faced the perils of vengeful
red men, wild beasts, and the rigorous winters
for the sake of the pittance paid at the frontier
posts and towns for the scant peltries carried
thither.</p>

<p>The man who rode up had but the single
animal, his worldly possessions being strapped
in place behind him, while his long, old-fashioned
rifle rested across the saddle in
front. His dress may be described as a cross
between that of a cowboy and an Indian. His
hat was of the sombrero order, but he wore a
skin hunting shirt, leggings and moccasins,
and possessed a massive frame which must
have been the repository of immense strength.</p>

<p>His face was a study. His hair was long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and, like the beard that covered his face,
plentifully sprinkled with gray. His small
eyes were light in color, restless, bright, and
twinkling; his nose large and Roman in form,
and his voice a mellow bass.</p>

<p>The trapper was yet several rods distant
when Lattin exclaimed in a surprised undertone:</p>

<p>“Why, that’s old Eph, as sure as I live!”</p>

<p>“So it is,” added Strubell; “I haven’t
seen him for years.”</p>

<p>The hunter recognized the Texan at the same
moment, and the movement of his heavy beard
showed he was smiling, though it was impossible
to see his mouth. He uttered a hearty
salutation as he came forward, and grasped
each hand in turn, being introduced by Strubell
to Herbert, who noticed the searching
look he fixed for a moment on his face.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know you, younker,” he said,
almost crushing his hand; “but I’m s’prised
to meet you so soon after seeing another; I
aint used to running agin boys in this part of
the world; but things seem to be gettin’ endways
the last few years, and I’ve made up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
mind thar’s powerful little in the trappin’
bus’ness any longer.”</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman, as Strubell announced him,
proved by the words just uttered that he had
seen Nick Ribsam, and therefore must have
news to impart. Since he had come directly
over the trail of the horse thieves, the Texans
had suspected the other fact before he made it
known.</p>

<p>After the exchange of a few questions and
answers, during which Bozeman stated that he
was on his way to Austin to hunt up an old
friend, who had been engaged for a number of
years in buying and selling mustangs, Strubell
explained the business that had brought him
and his companions over the border into New
Mexico.</p>

<p>“How far are we behind Rickard and the
others?”</p>

<p>The trapper turned in his saddle and looked
to the rear for a few seconds without speaking.
His forehead was wrinkled with thought,
but it did not take him long to answer the
question.</p>

<p>“You are thirty-five miles or tharabouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
from the Pecos, and Bell and Harman will
cross the stream about noon, which is two
hours off, so you may say thar is thirty miles
atween you.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t more than a dozen when we
started,” was the remark of the disgusted Lattin,
“so we have been losing ground for more
than a week that we’ve been chasing ‘em.”</p>

<p>“Thar can’t be any doubt of that ‘cordin’
to your own words,” replied the trapper; “but
if you keep on you’ll be up with ‘em by the
end of two days.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” asked
Strubell.</p>

<p>“‘Cause they’re goin’ to stop at the ranch
layin’ just beyond.”</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin exchanged glances, and
Herbert, who was watching them, was satisfied
that the news did not surprise them. They
had expected it from the first or they would
not have persevered thus far.</p>

<p>“I met ‘em yesterday,” continued Bozeman,
“not fur back; they had halted to cook a
young antelope that Harman shot, and I jined
in on the chorus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did they say to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ in partic’lar; I told ‘em whar I
was goin’, and asked ‘em what they war doin’
in this part of the world. They said they war
on thar way to look at that ranch I spoke
about on t’other side of the Pecos, and it
might be they would spend some time
thar.”</p>

<p>“Did they say anything about the boy with
them?” asked Herbert, whose curiosity was
at the highest point.</p>

<p>“Yas&mdash;consid’rable. I asked who he was
and whar he come from; Bell told me he
was a younker as wanted to take a trip
through Texas fur his health&mdash;though he’s
the healthiest younker I’ve looked on for
many a day&mdash;and tharfur they war takin’
him along.”</p>

<p>“Did you have anything to say to Nick?”</p>

<p>“Who’s Nick?” asked the trapper, with
another movement of the beard around his
mouth that showed he was smiling.</p>

<p>“He’s the boy&mdash;my friend that we’re looking
after.”</p>

<p>“I shook hands with him, give him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
good advice that he thanked me for, and that
was all.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he was afraid to say anything
more.”</p>

<p>“It must have been that; Bell and Harman
watched him powerful close, and though he
looked as if he would like to add something,
he didn’t. I tell you,” continued the trapper,
addressing Strubell and the others, “I
s’pected something was wrong, though I
didn’t say nothin’, ‘cause thar warn’t any
show for me doin’ anything. I’m s’prised to
hear what you say, and, boys, if you want me
to give you any help, I’m yours to command.”</p>

<p>This was said with a heartiness that left no
doubt of its sincerity. His friends were delighted
with the offer, and Herbert especially
was sure that no better thing could happen.
He assured old Eph he should be well paid for
his trouble. The trapper did not refuse,
though his proposal was made without any
idea of the kind; but, as he confessed, matters
had gone ill with him for a long time, and he
was in need of all he could honestly earn.</p>

<p>He had known Rickard and Slidham for ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
years, and was aware of the crooked business
in which they were engaged; but, inasmuch
as they did not cross his path, there was no
cause to quarrel with them. He had spent
more than one night in their company, and
would not hesitate to do so again, without
misgiving; but when he learned of their high-handed
outrage, his sturdy nature was filled
with wrath, and he declared himself eager not
only to help rescue the boy, but to punish
them for their crime.</p>

<p>This decision was reached within ten minutes
after the handshaking, and the trapper
wheeled his pony around and joined in the
pursuit without further delay.</p>

<p>Since it was clear that the others could not
be overtaken until they made their final halt,
the pursuers let down in their pace, and
allowed their animals to follow at a leisurely
rate.</p>

<p>It struck Herbert as very strange that the
destination of the enemies and friends of Nick
Ribsam should be the same. Though the former
could not have caught sight of their pursuers,
they must have known of it, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
now about to stop and give them time to come
up, and make battle, if they chose, for the
possession of the young man, who, without any
fault of his own, had become the bone of contention.</p>

<p>There was something about the business
that he could not understand; but by listening
to the stealthy conversation of his friends
he gained an inkling of the truth. He learned,
too, that they were less hopeful of success than
he. The almost endless pursuit, however, was
drawing to a close, and the end, whatever it
might be, was at hand.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A RACE WITH AN AVALANCHE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE little party had encamped in a hollow
in the prairie, where, after eating their
sparse lunch, they lolled on the ground, the
men smoking their pipes, while their animals
cropped the grass before lying down for the
rest which they needed as much as their
owners.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Eph Bozeman, after the conversation
had lasted a half hour, and took the
form of reminiscences on the part of the
adults, “I war eighteen years old when I went
on my first trappin’ hunt with my old friend
Kit Carson, and there war three trappers
beside us. I war younger in them days than
now, and I don’t quite understand how Kit
come to let me do one of the foolishest things
a younker of my age ever tried.</p>

<p>“It war in the fall of the year that we five
went away up in the Wild River Mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
meanin’ to stay thar till spring. Kit had been
in the same region a few years before, but he
said no trap had ever been set in the place, and
we was sure of makin’ a good haul before the
winter war over. It was November, and we
went to work at once. We were purty well
north, and so high up that I don’t think warm
weather ever strikes the place.</p>

<p>“We had good luck from the start, and by
the time snow began to fly had stowed away
in the cave we fixed up for our winter quarters
more peltries than Kit had took the whole
season before. That was good; but when we
begun to figure up how much money we war
going to have to divide down at Bent’s Fort,
after the winter war over, from the sale of the
furs, Kit shook his head and said the season
warn’t ended yet.</p>

<p>“Since we war sure of having ugly weather
we had got ready for it. The luggage that
war strapped to the back of our pack mules
had a pair of snow-shoes for each of us, and
we all knowed how to use ‘em.</p>

<p>“The first snow-fall come in the beginnin’
of December, but it didn’t amount to much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Howsumever, we catched it the next week,
heavy. It begun comin’ down one afternoon
just as it war growin’ dark. It war thin and
sand-like, and when it hit our faces stung like
needle p’ints. Carson went outside, and after
studyin’ the sky as best he could, when he
couldn’t see it at all, said it war goin’ to be
the storm of the winter.</p>

<p>“He war right, as he generally war in such
matters. When mornin’ come it war snowin’
harder than ever, and it never let up for four
days and nights. Then when it stopped the
fall war mor’n a dozen feet in the mountains.
This settled like, and a crust formed on top,
which war just the thing for our snow-shoes.
On the steep inclines you’ve only to brace
yourself and let the law of gravertation, as
I b’lieve they call it, do the rest.</p>

<p>“It war powerful lonely in our cave day
after day, with nothing to do but to talk and
smoke and sleep, and now and then steal out
to see if the mules war safely housed. It got
so bad after a while that we all put on our
snow-shoes and started out for a little fun.</p>

<p>“About a mile off we struck a gulch which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
we had all seen many times. It war the
steepest that we knowed of within fifty miles.
From the top to whar it broadened out into a
valley war three-quarters of a mile, and all
the way war like the roof of a house. I s’pose
it war a little more than a hundred yards wide
at the top, whar the upper part of the biggest
kind of an avalanche had formed. There the
wind and odd shape of the rocks and ground
had filled the place with snow that war deeper
than the tallest meetin’-house you ever laid
eyes on. It had drifted and piled, reachin’
far back till it war a snow mountain of itself.
Don’t you forget, too,” added the trapper
impressively, “that this snow warn’t loose
drift stuff, but a solid mass that, when it once
started, would go down that gulch like so
much rock, if you can think of a rock as big
as that.</p>

<p>“We war standin’ and lookin’ at this
mountain of snow, wonderin’ how long it
would be before it would swing loose and
plunge into the valley below, when a fool
feelin’ come over me. I turned to Kit and the
other fellers and offered to bet a beaver skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that I could start even with the avalanche and
beat it down into the valley. Carson wouldn’t
take the bet, for he saw what rashness it war.
Yet he didn’t try to dissuade me, and the
other chaps took me up right off. The idea
got into my head that Carson thought I war
afraid, and then nothin’ could have held me
back.</p>

<p>“It didn’t take us long to get things ready.
One of the trappers went with me to see that
the start war all right, while Kit and the other
picked thar way to the valley below, so as to
have a sight of the home stretch.</p>

<p>“It took us a good while, and we had to
work hard to make our way to the foot of the
avalanche. When we got thar at last and I
looked up at that mountain of snow ready to
tumble right over onto me, I don’t mind sayin’
I did feel weak in the knees; but I wouldn’t
have backed out if I knowed thar war only one
chance in a million of my ever livin’ to tell it.</p>

<p>“The chap with me said if I wanted to give
it up it would be all right&mdash;he told me afterward
that he war sorry he had took my bet&mdash;but
I laughed, and told him it war a go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“He helped me fix my snow-shoes, and
wouldn’t let me start till he seen everything
war right. Then I stood on the edge of the
gulch and held myself still by graspin’ the
corner of the rock behind me. He climbed
above, so he could peep over and see me. He
said I war so far below that I looked like a fly,
and I know that he didn’t look much bigger
than that to me. It took him so long to climb
to the perch that my hand was beginnin’ to
grow numb, when I heard his voice, faint and
distant-like:</p>

<p>“‘Hello, Eph, down thar! Are you
ready?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, and tired of waitin’,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three!</i>’</p>

<p>“As he said the last word, and it was so
faint that I could hardly hear him, him and
me fired our pistols at the same time, as you
sometimes see at a foot race, though thar they
ginerally have but the one pistol.</p>

<p>“You understand how it was,” added the
trapper for the benefit of Herbert Watrous:
“them shots war fur the avalanche. Bein’ as
we war startin’ on a foot race, it war right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that we should have a fair start, and the only
way of doin’ that was by settin’ off some gunpowder.
If the avalanche was hangin’, as it
seemed to be, the shakin’ of the air made by
our pistols would set it loose and start it down
the valley after me. But onless it war
balanced just that way the broadside of a
frigate wouldn’t budge it.</p>

<p>“Howsumever, that war the lookout of the
avalanche and not mine, but, bein’ as I meant
it should be fair and square, I waited after
firin’ my pistol, lookin’ and listenin’. I didn’t
mean to start in ahead of the thing, nor did
I mean it should get the best of me. As
like as not it wouldn’t budge, and then of
course the race war off.</p>

<p>“For a second or two I couldn’t hear
nothin’ but the moanin’ of the wind away up
where the other feller had climbed. Then I
heard a sound like the risin’ of a big storm.
It war low and faint at first, but it quickly
growed into the most awful roar mortal man
ever heard. Just then my friend shouted:</p>

<p>“‘<i>Here she comes! Off with you!</i>’</p>

<p>“I give myself a shove out over the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the snow, curvin’ about, so that when I
reached the middle of the gulch I started
downward. In that second or two I seen the
whole avalanche under way, hardly a hundred
yards off, and it war comin’ for me like a railroad
train, and goin’ faster every second.</p>

<p>“You can make up your mind that I war
doin’ some tall travellin’ myself.</p>

<p>“Whew! boys, I can’t tell you much about
that race. The avalanche didn’t flatten out
and shoot down the gorge in loose masses, as
I’ve seen ‘em do, but just stuck together and
come like one solid half of the mountain itself.</p>

<p>“If it catched me I was a goner just as sure
as if run down by a steam-engine. But you
would think thar couldn’t be any chance of it
catchin’ me, ’cause it war gravertation that was
pullin’ us both, and one oughter go as fast as
t’other. The only thing I had to do was to keep
my feet and stay in the middle of the gorge.
If I catched one of my toes in the snow crust
I would tumble, and before I could help myself
the avalanche would squelch me.</p>

<p>“I can never forget, but I can’t tell how I
felt goin’ down that three-quarters of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
like a cannon ball. The wind cut my face as
if it war a harrycane, and everything was so
misty like I couldn’t see anything plain, and
so I war in mortal fear of turnin’ out of the
course and hittin’ the side of the gulch.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it war, but once I felt
myself goin’ over. I s’pose I must have got
out of line and tried to get back without
exactly knowin’ what I war doin’. Kit Carson,
who war watchin’ me, said I went two
hundred feet balanced on one snow-shoe. He
then give me up, for he war sure thar warn’t a
shadder of a chance for me.</p>

<p>“But I swung back agin, and, keepin’ to
the middle of the gulch, soon struck the level,
and went skimmin’ away as fast as ever till I
begun goin’ up the incline on t’other side. I
war doin’ that in fine style when the p’int of
one of my shoes dipped under the snow crust,
and I know I turned a round dozen summersets
before I stopped. It sort of mixed things
in my brain, but the snow saved me from
gettin’ hurt, and though the avalanche come
powerful close, it didn’t quite reach me, and I
won my beaver skin.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE RANCH.</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">EPH BOZEMAN was so familiar with the
Pecos River, from its source in the
Rocky Mountains to its junction with the Rio
Grande, that he conducted his friends to a fording
place, where it was crossed without any of
them wetting their feet. Riding up the opposite
bank, they started across the comparatively
level country, and by the middle of the
afternoon struck a piece of grazing ground,
which the hunters told him belonged to the
ranch that the banker, Mr. Lord, had sent
Strubell and Lattin to inspect.</p>

<p>The lands were so extensive that there were
many portions from which not the first
glimpse could be gained of the adobe structure
that was erected nearly a half century before.</p>

<p>The little party pushed onward, and before
the sun dipped below the horizon began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
ascent of a moderate slope, from the top of
which the coveted view could be obtained.</p>

<p>Since Rickard and his companion must have
known of the pursuit, they would be on the
lookout for the Texans, who were eager to
befriend Nick Ribsam. It was decided not to
allow them to know the cowboys had arrived
in the vicinity before the following day.
Strubell hinted that important events might
be brought about between the setting and the
rising of the sun.</p>

<p>Herbert, who began to feel a natural nervousness
as the crisis approached, made several
inquiries about Jim-John, the half-breed, and
his companion, who had been left behind.
Were they not likely to abandon the pack
horses on discovering they had been flanked
by the Texans, and hasten to the help of the
couple that had been the first to cross over
from Western Texas to New Mexico? But
when Eph Bozeman agreed with Strubell and
Lattin that there was nothing to be feared
of that nature, Herbert bade good-by to his
fears and fixed his attention on that which was
in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving their animals in the hollow, where
they were safe against disturbance, the four
climbed the elevation, the youth carrying one
field glass, while Strubell had the other. The
trapper had never used anything of the kind,
and refused to do so now. He claimed that
his eyes were as good as ever&mdash;and he was
undoubtedly right&mdash;and he needed no artificial
aid.</p>

<p>It looked like useless precaution, but on
reaching the crest the party crouched low
in order to render themselves less conspicuous.</p>

<p>“Thar she is!” said old Eph, extending his
left hand to westward, while his right grasped
his inseparable rifle; “and I’ll bet them new-fangled
machines won’t show you anything
more than I see this very minute.”</p>

<p>A mile away stood a broad, firm building, of
a slatish yellow color as seen through the
clear air. It was of adobe or sun-dried bricks,
which, in the course of time, had become compact
and hard enough to resist a bombardment
of six-pounders better than many forts erected
for that purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-232.jpg" width="450" height="289"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“<i>A mile away stood a broad, firm building.</i>”</p>
                          <p class="pcap">Page <a href="#Page_224">224</a>.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The land immediately surrounding the
structure was smooth and quite level, and
covered with grass which wore a soft, beautiful
tint, mellowed by the intervening distance.
On the further side of the building were a
few bushes, bearing a resemblance to the well
known mesquite growth so common in many
portions of the Southwest.</p>

<p>These were the main features of the scene
when viewed by the unaided eye, but the
helpful field glass added something.</p>

<p>Lying on his face, with his instrument
pointed at the building, Herbert Watrous
studied it closely. He offered the instrument
to Lattin, but he, seeing how much the youth
was interested, declined, and waited until
Strubell was ready to pass the other to
him.</p>

<p>The youth noted the broad door in the
middle, with a small narrow window on either
side of the upper story. The front was like
that of an immense box, there being little
slope to the roof. It was probably one of
those mission houses built in the preceding
century by the Jesuits, who devoted their lives
to the conversion of the Indians, and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
having been abandoned by them as civilization
advanced, had been taken possession of
by those who secured a claim to the extensive
tract which surrounded it.</p>

<p>Being questioned on this point, Bozeman as
well as the Texans replied that such was
undoubtedly the fact, for it was far different
from the flimsy structures of wood used by
ranchmen in other sections. There was a
court inside, after the fashion of the older
houses in Spanish countries, the building itself
enclosing this open space, so that when manned
by only a few, it was capable of withstanding
the attack of a large force.</p>

<p>Bozeman stated further that the ranch was
abandoned because of the Indians. While
the men who made their homes there were
safe so long as they stayed behind the wall,
they could not afford to remain there. Hundreds
of cattle had been killed or run off by
the Apaches, whose chief hunting grounds are
further west, until the ranchmen who essayed
the business became discouraged and gave it
up.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the place had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
allowed to run to waste for years. During
that time the grazing had improved, though a
large part of the thousands of acres had paid
tribute to other cattlemen. Besides this, the
marauding Apaches, with which our government
was having much trouble at that time,
were mainly in the western part of the territory
and in Arizona. This made the ranch so
inviting that it was beginning to attract attention,
and when Mr. Lord, in San Antonio, was
offered it for what was really a small sum,
he was warranted in sending a couple of
trustworthy experts to examine and report
upon it.</p>

<p>This was the destination toward which
the Texans and Herbert Watrous had been
riding through many long days, and that
was now in sight. By a strange order of
things, which at present he could not understand,
the ranch was the objective point also
of the two evil men who held Nick Ribsam
as prisoner.</p>

<p>He had puzzled his brain many times to read
the meaning of all this; but though he had
formed his theory, he forced himself to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
content to wait until the Texans or events
themselves should reveal the truth.</p>

<p>The most careful scrutiny of the front and
eastern side of the adobe building failed to
show any sign of life. That, however, was no
proof that it was not there. The horsemen
might have ridden abreast through the broad
door, closing it after them, placed their horses
within the numerous quarters facing the court
within, and then, climbing to the roof, watch
the eastern horizon for a sign of their pursuers.</p>

<p>Fully ten minutes passed without a word
being spoken by our friends, who were inspecting
the building from the crest of the elevation.
They were so intent on their work that
nothing else was thought of.</p>

<p>Having studied every foot that was visible,
Herbert went over it again several times, but
with no better success than at first. He was
gifted with fine eyesight, and, when he finally
lowered his glass with a sigh, he glanced
across at Strubell, who, having passed the
other instrument to Lattin, was looking
expectantly into the face of the youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you make out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find anything at all,” replied
Herbert. “Did you?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; Rickard, Slidham, and Nick
are there, but a bigger surprise awaits <i>them</i>
than <i>us</i>.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Point your glass over to the left,” replied
the Texan, “and I think you will see something
that will surprise you.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">BELL RICKARD’S SCHEME.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">HERBERT WATROUS turned his field
glass to the left, and, for the first time
since he caught sight of the adobe structure,
gave attention to another part of his field of
vision.</p>

<p>The cause of the Texan’s remark was apparent.
A half mile beyond the building was
a party of horsemen, numbering perhaps a
dozen. They were grouped together and apparently
holding a discussion over some matter
in which all must have been interested, since
they kept in such close order.</p>

<p>The youth had become accustomed to seeing
Indians since leaving San Antonio, and needed
no one to tell him that these people belonged
to that race. The distance was too far for
them to show distinctly through the instrument,
but enough was seen to settle the
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“What tribe are they?” he asked, addressing
all his companions. Strubell was studying
them without the glass, while Lattin had
turned his gaze thither, and Eph was lying on
his face, his brows wrinkled, his gaze concentrated
on the group. It was he who answered:</p>

<p>“‘Paches, every one of them.”</p>

<p>“Are they not off their hunting grounds?”
asked Herbert.</p>

<p>“Not ‘cordin’ to thar ideas, for every
‘Pache believes that the whole North American
continent belongs to his people, which is
about what every redskin thinks. Howsumever,
they ginerally do thar killin’ and deviltry
further over in Arizona, but them’s ‘Paches
sure as you’re born.”</p>

<p>“They seem to be as much interested in the
building as we are.”</p>

<p>“They’ve seen Rickard and Slidham and
the younker go in thar, and they’re tryin’ to
figure out what it means. You see things are
in a quar’ shape in these parts.”</p>

<p>While the party lay on the crest of the
elevation, looking at the building and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
council of warriors beyond, Strubell for the
first time showed a desire to make known to
Herbert Watrous the things that had puzzled
him. The strange enterprise had now reached
a point where he was willing to talk. He had
consulted with Lattin and Eph until there was
an agreement all round, and no cause for
further secrecy existed. In fact, there had
never been any real cause for it at all.</p>

<p>Without quoting the Texan’s words, it may
be said that in the minds of the party it was
clear that Belden Rickard, the noted horse
thief, with his companion Harman Slidham,
was carrying out a scheme to secure a ransom
for the restoration of Nick Ribsam to his
friends.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Herbert had
held this belief more than once, but he saw so
many difficulties in the way that he was
awaiting another explanation. He now asked
Strubell to clear up the points that perplexed
him, and he did, so far as he could.</p>

<p>He wished to learn why, if Rickard had
formed the plan for the capture of Nick, with
the idea of restoring him to freedom on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
payment of a sum of money, he had ridden
hundreds of miles to reach the point of conference,
when it might as well have been held
in Texas, and within sight of the very ridge
where Nick fell into the power of his enemies.
It was this phase of the question that had
troubled Herbert greatly and led him to fear
the ruffian intended to take the life of his
friend.</p>

<p>Strubell replied that during the conversation
with Rickard, whom he had known for years,
he picked up more than one item of news
which surprised him. One was that while
making his long rides through the Southwest,
he and his companions, when hard pressed,
were accustomed, at times, to take refuge in the
old mansion house on the ranch which Mr. Lord
proposed buying. This had been abandoned,
as I have already stated, for years; but in the
hospitable West, where every person’s doors
are open, no one would have hesitated to enter
the adobe structure, whenever cause existed
for doing so.</p>

<p>Rickard saw signs of others having been
there, though he did not believe the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ever passed through the broad doors into the
courtyard beyond. Had there been a party of
settlers or white men within they would have
been eager to do so, but while it was empty the
incitement was lacking.</p>

<p>Rickard and his gang were in a peculiar situation.
The Texans had reason to believe
that he had fully twenty desperate associates
in pushing his unlawful business over an
immense extent of territory, though it was
rare that they all came together. They were
not only in danger from Indians, as were all
who ventured into that section, but they were
outlawed by their own race. It was dangerous
for any member of the gang to trust himself
within reach of the law, while the rough bordermen
would have strung up every one without
hesitation could they have laid hands on
them.</p>

<p>Leading this wild, lawless life, it was necessary
for these ruffians to have retreats, where
they could feel comparatively safe. A number
of such were at command. Some were deep in
the mountains, and one was the abandoned
ranch. Standing in the middle of a vast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
comparatively level plain this had many advantages
over the others, while it was also
deficient in more than one respect.</p>

<p>Among the secret compartments in the old
mission house was a store-room for provisions,
where Rickard saw that enough grain was kept
to last him and several companions for weeks.
There was a spring of water that could not be
shut off, so that a small garrison could stand
an indefinite siege from a large number. In
this place, the great horse thief and his followers,
whether few or many, might feel safe.</p>

<p>Had Rickard, after securing the custody of
Nick Ribsam, proposed his plan of ransom, he
would have been in an awkward situation.
Any messenger that he might send forward
could be made prisoner by the Texans and held
as a hostage. The little party itself was liable
to be assailed and destroyed, for no mercy
would have been showed at such a time,
though a certain rude chivalry prevailed in
other respects.</p>

<p>In what way would the situation be improved
if Rickard took his prisoner to the
adobe building? This was the question which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Herbert asked and the answer to which was
simple.</p>

<p>Behind the walls of the massive structure
it was easy for Rickard to communicate by
word of mouth without any risk to himself.
He need not send out a messenger to be captured,
but could make known his terms to
Nick’s friends, who would be at liberty to
accept or reject them.</p>

<p>It was the strong suspicion that such was
the purpose of the ruffians that led the Texans
to make every effort to overtake them before
they reached their refuge. Could they have
brought Rickard and his companion to bay
they would have forced their own terms upon
him.</p>

<p>But the criminal was too cunning thus to be
caught. Leaving the pack horses for Jim-John
and Brindage to look after, he pushed on with
such vigor that, as we have shown, the refuge
was attained in spite of all the pursuers could
do to prevent it.</p>

<p>Rickard was an honest fellow in his early
days and had done scouting duty in the company
of Arden Strubell. It was this fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
led the latter to show him a certain consideration
when he was made prisoner by Nick Ribsam,
though there might have been other situations
in which they would have flown at
each other with irrestrainable wrath.</p>

<p>It was Strubell who was the innocent cause
of the plight of Nick Ribsam. While he and
Rickard were talking of nothing in particular,
by the camp fire, hundreds of miles away, the
cowboy indulged in a little quiet boasting
about the two youths who were his companions.
He represented them as sons of
wealthy parents, who allowed them to do as
they chose, and they were now enjoying a
vacation after their own hearts.</p>

<p>It was this statement that gave Rickard his
idea before he left camp. He hated the sturdy
Nick intensely enough to shoot him down at
the first opportunity, but to do that would
intensify the anger against him, while it could
do him no good, except so far as the satisfying
of his revenge went; but if he took the boy to
one of his safe retreats, he might force a good
round sum from his rich parents to secure his
safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The scheme savored strongly of the style of
doing business in classic Greece, but you need
not be told that it has been carried to a successful
issue more than once within these
glorious United States of America.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WATCHING AND WAITING.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE presence of the Apaches within a
short distance of the building brought
about a complication for which the rescue
party were as unprepared as were the whites
within the structure. But for them, one of
Nick’s friends would have ridden forward and
opened a conversation with Rickard, by which
the terms of the exchange could have been
effected with little delay. Herbert told Strubell
that unless the criminal demanded an
exorbitant price, it should be accepted.
Although he had only a small amount of
funds with him, he would give him a draft
that would be honored without question by
Mr. Lord in San Antonio; and if Rickard
kept his part of the agreement, it would be
respected by Herbert and his companions,
who were governed by a sense of honor that
would prevent any advantage being taken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
circumstances that must of necessity be in
their favor.</p>

<p>But if one of the party advanced to open
communication, he would be observed by the
watchful Apaches before a safe point was
reached. Since Rickard must know of the
presence of the red men, it was likely he
would admit such an applicant the moment
he saw his danger, but a sudden dash of the
warriors might shut him out from the refuge.</p>

<p>The man would not allow the whole party to
enter, inasmuch as that would disarrange his
own plans, though he was not apt to object to
the visit of one of their number. As yet, he
could not have learned that the white men
were behind the elevation of the prairie.</p>

<p>The simple question, therefore, was as to
how Strubell and his companions could
negotiate with Rickard without betraying
themselves to the Apaches. Furthermore, it
must not be forgotten that the situation of the
three men and boy was extremely dangerous.
They were on the open prairie, and liable to
be discovered by the red men, even with the
exercise of the extremest care on their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
part. Such discovery was almost certain to be
followed by a desperate fight, with the chances
overwhelmingly against our friends.</p>

<p>This will be conceded when it is remembered
that Geronimo and his fierce miscreants, who
defied our forces in the Southwest so long,
never numbered more than a fractional part of
the white soldiers. Those Apaches are born
fighters, and the most dangerous Indians that
ever trod the American continent. A dozen
of them, well mounted, would make short
work of three white men and one boy, no
matter how bravely they might defend themselves.
Eph Bozeman and the Texan friends
were sure to do well and would tumble more
than one of their assailants from the saddle,
but their own ultimate destruction was inevitable.</p>

<p>The situation being as I have shown, it will
be seen that the presence of the Apaches
immeasurably increased the peril. It was
agreed that no movement should be made
until nightfall, up to which time the main
object would be to avoid discovery by the
swarthy raiders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>This was so important that Strubell and
Lattin made their way back to where the
ponies were grazing, and forced all of them
to lie down. The four were so well trained
that they readily obeyed. They would keep
that posture, though suffering from hunger,
until ordered to rise. There was no water
within reach, a deprivation which the men
felt as much as did the animals.</p>

<p>It should be stated that the words of Strubell
about the plans of Bell Rickard gave Herbert
a reasonable explanation of the course of Nick
Ribsam, which, until then, was as much of a
puzzle as the conduct of his captors. Doubtless
he had been convinced from the words and
action of his party that his life was not in
immediate danger, and he therefore refrained
from increasing their enmity by any attempt
at escape. Had a good chance presented, he
would have been quick to take it, but he
was carefully watched and he bided his
time.</p>

<p>Returning from the animals, the Texans lay
down on the grass beside Herbert and Bozeman,
and resumed watching the Apaches, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
an occasional study of the front of the building
for signs of the party behind the walls.</p>

<p>The Indians remained grouped in close order
for nearly half an hour. Then one of their
number galloped off for a hundred yards or
more, circled about, and returned. Shortly
after, a couple did the same thing.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that means?” asked
Eph of Herbert.</p>

<p>“I have no idea.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean nothin’; it’s hard for a
redskin to set still, though he can do it for
hours at a stretch when he sees a chance of lifting
any ha’r. Them chaps, and their ponies
too, get tired of stayin’ in one spot, so they
take a little spurt like that to set thar blood
goin’. Thar they go again!”</p>

<p>The party broke apart, and soon the whole
company were circling about and back and
forth like a lot of equestrians in a circus ring.
They doubled in and out, in the most bewildering
fashion, but the men, who devoted
themselves to watching them closely, agreed
that there were about a dozen, as at first supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>These exhibitions of horsemanship were of
special interest to the party lying down behind
the elevation, for the Apaches needed not to
extend their circling far to pass behind the
ridge, when they would be sure to discover
them. And just about that time, as Strubell
expressed it, the band would begin to
play.</p>

<p>The red men rode so far to the eastward
more than once that this discovery seemed
inevitable. It caused much anxiety, and our
friends withdrew their attention for a time
from the building and kept it upon their more
active enemies.</p>

<p>The situation was peculiarly trying to Herbert
Watrous, who understood his danger in
case of an attack from the Apaches. He
would be perilously placed because of his
inexperience. In fact, it struck him more
than once that Nick had much the better of it
as compared with him.</p>

<p>The one fortunate thing was that the afternoon
was near to its close, and the night must
lessen the danger, so far as the Apaches were
concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter were acting out their ferocious
nature. When they knew the adobe building
was empty, it possessed no attraction to them.
They passed it by without so much as firing
a shot at its gray walls, but, when they saw
three horsemen ride through the broad
entrance, they halted, and began laying their
plans for destroying them. That’s Apache
nature, but perhaps, after all, it is not so
different to the nature of the white man.</p>

<p>It was decided by the Texans that Eph
Bozeman should ride forward to meet Bell
Rickard. His relations with the horse thieves
insured against the distrust they were likely
to feel in the case of either of the others.
He would doubtless be admitted without misgiving,
and once within the building, he could
complete arrangements for the ransom of Nick
Ribsam.</p>

<p>It was Eph’s choice to go on foot, though
in the event of detection by the Apaches his
case was likely to be hopeless, whereas, if he
were mounted on his fleet plug, he might dash
off and escape.</p>

<p>That which decided the old trapper was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
greater liability of being discovered if he rode
a horse. The Apaches were certain to manœuvre
about the building in the darkness, searching
for a way of making a stealthy inroad on
the defenders, and it was too much to expect
them to fail to see a horseman seeking entrance
through the regular avenue. Instead of
walking erect, he would creep on his hands
and knees, from the moment he reached the
rim of the danger circle until he knocked at
the door. By this course, though it involved
much delay, he could use his marvellous expertness,
trained to the highest point by
a half century among the wilds of the Great
West.</p>

<p>Old Eph had done the same thing before.
He and Kit Carson once crept a full mile, over
the cactus plains in Southern California, to
elude a band of Navajoes that had followed
them for several days and nights, and the
injuries received during that ordeal were felt
for months afterward.</p>

<p>He was glad of the chance to repeat the
difficult feat, for he had lived an adventurous
life too long to lose his liking for it, now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
he was growing old. Besides, such persons
are unwilling to admit any failure of their
powers until the proof is forced upon them so
impressively that it is impossible to deceive
themselves.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SOUND OF A PISTOL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">JUST as night was closing in, an occurrence
took place which caused our friends more
alarm than anything during the day.</p>

<p class="pn">Their position was almost due east of the
adobe building, which it will be remembered
was about a mile distant. The Apaches, who
had been circling about on their ponies in an
aimless way, drew nearer the building, until in
the gathering gloom they were seen to be only
a few hundred yards’ distant.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of their number dashed off
with his horse on a dead run to the east. He
did not take a course toward the whites, but
aimed for the elevation which extended in a
southerly direction. It looked as if he meant
to learn whether any friends of the little garrison
were in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“If he goes over the ridge,” said Strubell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a low tone, as all eyes were fixed on him, “he
must see us.”</p>

<p>He did not pass over, but halted at the top
and sat motionless on the bare back of his
pony, evidently engaged in scanning every
portion of the visible prairie. At this moment
old Eph glanced at the animals, a short way
behind them, and saw that his horse was in the
act of rising. His forequarters were up, and
his head raised, after the manner of his kind,
when his master spoke sharply and he immediately
sank back again.</p>

<p>The action of the steed was as singular as it
was unfortunate, and for a minute everyone
was sure the discovery had been made. But
the action of the Apache to the south left the
matter in doubt. He wheeled about and rode
back to his comrades at an easier pace, but
they did not gather around him, as they would
have been quite sure to do if he had borne important
news to them.</p>

<p>The result was that neither Bozeman nor the
Texans knew whether the Apache had seen
them or not&mdash;a state of doubt as trying as
actual discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The belief was that the action of the horse
had not betrayed them, for, until the red men
faded from view in the deepening gloom,
nothing to show the contrary was observable.</p>

<p>The night promised to be favorable for the
dangerous enterprise. It would be quite dark,
the moon not appearing until late, there was
no wind, and, in the stillness, the slightest
sound could be heard for a long distance. If
the Apaches knew nothing of the party behind
the elevation, they would be likely to remain
on their horses, whose tread could be detected
long before they were visible, while the
advance of old Eph was to be in such utter
silence that even the wonderfully fine hearing
of an Apache would avail him naught.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to start soon,” said the trapper,
“and I want to know what’s to be said to
Bell, if I get the chance to talk with him.”</p>

<p>“In the first place,” said Strubell, by way
of reply, “Herbert is to fix the price of the
ransom he’s willing to pay.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I ought to give?”
asked the youth, who had thought a good deal
over the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;but it seems to me that a
thousand dollars should be the outside figure.
What do you think, Baker?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred is my idea, but I wouldn’t
think of goin’ above what you say.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the surprised Herbert, “I
had fixed five thousand as the limit, not knowing
but that I might exceed that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“Five thousand dollars,” repeated old Eph,
with a low whistle, for the sum to him was a
prodigious fortune.</p>

<p>“Well, Eph can figure as best he can, but
I will agree that that sum shall be paid, if
Rickard will take nothing less.”</p>

<p>“How are you goin’ to pay it? What are
the tarms?” asked the trapper, who knew
nothing about the forms of “exchange,” as it
was proper to term the business in view.</p>

<p>“You can say to him that, if he will send
Nick and his horse back to us unharmed,
I will give him a draft on Mr. Lord in San
Antonio for whatever sum you agree upon.
He will understand that. I have the blanks
with me, and can fill them in with pencil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which is as legal as ink. Then all he has to do
is to hand the paper to Mr. Lord, who will
give him the money without question. I will
let him have another piece of writing which
will insure that.”</p>

<p>It was all a mystery to the old trapper, who
had never seen anything of the kind, and
perhaps there would be more difficulty in the
way than the hopeful Herbert believed, but it
was the best that offered, and since Rickard
must, of necessity, be compelled to trust the
others to a certain extent, he was not likely to
propose other terms.</p>

<p>The matter was made clear, so far as could
be done, to Eph, who, to insure he was right,
repeated his instructions until they were pronounced
correct by the others. Strubell, having
some education himself, helped to force
the bit of knowledge into his brain.</p>

<p>“S’pose he says he won’t do it for five
thousand, but wants six, or seven, or more&mdash;what
then?” asked Eph.</p>

<p>“Make the best bargain you can; I am willing
you should go up to six, seven&mdash;yes, ten
thousand,” added Herbert, who felt in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
moment that there was nothing too much for
him to do for the best friend he had in the
world.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” asked the amazed
Strubell. “What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I’m in earnest,” was the resolute reply of
the youth, who shuddered at the thought that
a little haggling at the crisis might bring about
the death of Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Texan, “since you talk
that way, you can set it down as certain
that Bell Rickard will turn Nick over in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yas,” added old Eph, “and go into the
bus’ness of stealin’ younkers instead of hosses,
for it will pay him much bigger.”</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing you can work in,”
remarked Lattin, “that is, that he won’t have
any trouble in gettin’ any sum up to five
thousand, but when you go above that, there’s
sure to be difficulty and he may lose the whole
thing.”</p>

<p>All agreed that this was a clever idea which
would have weight with the horse thief. The
trapper promised to make the best use of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing more to settle,
and Eph was ready to start.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ straight for the front of the
buildin’,” he said, “for the chance is as good
on one side as t’other, but it will take me
a good while to git thar.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you run into trouble,” suggested
Strubell, “you must make a break for us and
we’ll do what we can for you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do nothin’ of the kind,” was the
reply of the trapper, “for that would be the
last of you; I’ve got to go under some time,
and what difference whether it’s sooner or
later? If the varmints jump onto me, I’ll
make the best fight I kin, but I don’t want
any of you foolin’ round; all you need to do
is to look out for yourselves and leave me
alone.”</p>

<p>It was useless to argue with old Eph, and no
one tried to do so. After all, he was more
likely to be right than wrong, though it
seemed cruel to remain idle when he was in
extremity.</p>

<p>“Wal, I’m off,” he said, rising to his feet and
striding down the slope toward the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>As he did so he formed a striking figure.
He loomed up large and massive in the gloom,
with his long rifle grasped in his left hand,
and his right resting on the revolver which he
carried in the girdle about his waist. He took
long steps, for he was so far from his destination
that it was too soon to creep, but as his
moccasins pressed the grass, not one of those
watching him heard any sound. The progress
of a shadow across the wall could not have
been more silent.</p>

<p>The huge form quickly melted into the
gloom, and all was still. Not once had the
Apaches given utterance to their whoops, and
they were so distant that the sounds of their
horses’ hoofs could not reach the watchers, a
fact which the latter took as proof that the
warriors had not discovered their presence on
the elevation.</p>

<p>The minutes that followed were trying.
The Texans knew that a long time must elapse
before the trapper would reappear, even if
the circumstances were favorable; in fact half
the night was likely to pass ere he would show
up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>As nearly as they could judge, an hour had
gone, during which the same profound quiet
held reign, when all were startled by the sharp
crack of a pistol from the direction taken by
the trapper.</p>

<p>“What I feared!” whispered Lattin;
“he’s in trouble!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THROUGH THE NIGHT.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHILE Herbert Watrous lay on the
ground, at the top of the elevation,
with the Texans waiting for the return of the
old trapper, he asked Strubell to explain their
action on the night of the first norther, when
they sent him and Nick through the hills to
the other side.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the cowboy, “our first purpose
was to have you out of the way when the
scrimmage took place, for we knew it was coming
sure.”</p>

<p>“But you said you had no trouble with
Rickard and his gang.”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t; off in another direction
was a party of Comanches that must have
taken us for their own warriors, for they began
signalling in a way that made it look so. We
answered their signals, but they found out the
trick before we could trap them. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
they were out for game, and they came at us
in the evening. It isn’t worth while to give
the particulars,” added the Texan significantly,
“but when the fun opened it wasn’t
long before the red gentlemen found out their
mistake. They rode off&mdash;that is, some of them
did&mdash;and that was all.”</p>

<p>“But what of Rickard and his men?”</p>

<p>“While we were having the row with the
Comanches they played a clever trick on us.
They got round through the ridge, without our
suspecting it till next morning, and walked off
with Nick.”</p>

<p>“They might as well have captured both of
us,” said Herbert, “and I have often wondered
that they did not.”</p>

<p>“They took the highest priced one,” observed
Strubell, with a chuckle, “but I guess
there was another reason. Bell had a spite
against Nick, and meant to put him out of the
way if he couldn’t fix the ransom business.
While the main thing was money with him, it
wasn’t that alone.”</p>

<p>This point in the story was reached when
the three heard the report of old Eph’s pistol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which rang out on the night with startling
distinctness. It was nearer the building than
the elevation where the friends were awaiting
the return of the trapper.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” exclaimed Strubell in an
excited undertone, “I can’t stay here, knowing
he needs our help, for all he told us to do
so.”</p>

<p>“And I feel the same way,” added Lattin,
rising partly to his feet, “but what about
leaving Herbert here?”</p>

<p>It was this thought that held the two for
a moment, but the youth hastened to say:</p>

<p>“If you can do him any good, go at once;
I am in no danger.”</p>

<p>“I think not, but I aint sure. If anything
disturbs you,” added the elder, “mount your
horse and make off; your pony can go as fast
as any of theirs.”</p>

<p>But for the belief, confirmed by the action
of the Apaches, that they did not suspect the
presence of the whites, neither Strubell nor
Lattin would have allowed Herbert to be
alone; but they knew that if they were to
help the trapper not a second was to be lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of mounting their animals, they hurried
down the slope on foot, breaking into
a run, or rather loping trot, which enabled
them to cover much ground with little noise,
as their feet pressed the greensward.</p>

<p>The distance was considerable, and when
they approached the spot where the pistol had
been fired, they slackened their pace, listening
and peering into the gloom, which was so deep
that they could see no more than fifty feet in
any direction.</p>

<p>“This must be near the place,” whispered
Lattin, “but where is he?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good sign if we can’t find him, though
I don’t understand why he used his pistol
unless he was in trouble.”</p>

<p>As nearly as they could judge, they were
within two or three hundred yards of the
building. It was so easy to err as to the point
whence the report had come that they paused,
undecided what to do.</p>

<p>Darkness was on every hand. Not the first
outlines of the structure could be distinguished,
nor was there a glimpse of any man
or animal. The stars were shining brightly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the clear sky, and their light was all that
guided their progress.</p>

<p>“We’ll go a little further,” said Strubell in
the same guarded undertone, “but we must be
on the watch, for we’re in a bad place ourselves.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sh!</i>” At that moment, they caught the
sound of a horse’s hoofs, their experience telling
them the animal was on a gallop. The
noise was faint&mdash;quickly dying out, thus showing
that the pony was receding instead of approaching.
Nothing, therefore, was to be
feared from the rider of that particular animal.</p>

<p>To guard against passing their friend, the
Texans now separated a few paces, taking care
to keep within sight of each other. They
pushed forward at a moderate walk, on the
alert for the first evidence of danger.</p>

<p>A couple of rods were traversed in this manner
when Lattin, who was on the left, emitted a
faint hissing sound. At the same instant he
sank to the ground, and Strubell was hardly a
second behind him in doing the same. He saw
nothing, but he knew that his friend did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>A form so dim, shadowy, and indistinct that
he could trace nothing more than its outlines
took shape in the gloom itself, a short distance
in front of Lattin, who was so quick to utter
the warning to his companion. It was not a
horseman, but a man on foot.</p>

<p>The suspicion that it might be the trapper
caused the Texan to give another faint call&mdash;so
faint indeed that the alert ear of an Apache
would not have noticed it. Old Eph would be
sure, however, to read its meaning.</p>

<p>But the reply was not satisfactory. Instead
of answering it with a similar signal, the
silence was not broken, and, while the Texan
was peering into the darkness, he became
aware that he was staring at vacancy. The
form had melted into the gloom&mdash;proof that
it was moving in another direction.</p>

<p>“It must have been one of the varmints,”
whispered Lattin, as he stepped noiselessly to
the side of his friend, “but I didn’t s’pose
they was walkin’ round instead of ridin’ their
animals.”</p>

<p>“They must suspect something; I guess
Eph got through, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll go a little further,” said Lattin,
turning to the left again; “maybe he’s hurt
so bad he can’t help himself.”</p>

<p>The stillness continued, until once more
they came together with the decision to return
to the elevation where they had left Herbert.
The fact that the Apaches were moving about
on foot caused uneasiness concerning him, and
they thought it best to return at once.</p>

<p>“Do you see it?” asked Strubell.</p>

<p>“Yes; we’re further along than I thought.”</p>

<p>It was the old mission building to which
they alluded. It loomed to view in the darkness,
its outlines dimly traceable against the
starlit sky beyond. Not the first glimmer of
a light showed, nor could the strained ear catch
the semblance of a sound. But for that
glimpse of the man on foot they would have
believed the Apaches had departed with the
coming of night.</p>

<p>It was idle to stay longer, and they turned
about, moving off with the same care displayed
from the first, for they were more anxious
than either would confess to rejoin the youth,
further away than they wished was the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of their venture did much to
relieve them of fear concerning Eph Bozeman,
though it was not altogether satisfactory. He
might have collided with several Apaches on
foot, and been despatched. It was impossible
in the darkness to strike the exact spot where
the meeting occurred, and, for aught they
knew, the body of the old trapper was lying at
that moment, cold and lifeless, with the face
upturned to the stars.</p>

<p>As the distance from the building increased,
the Texans hastened their footsteps, and it
was a striking proof of their skill in such
delicate situations that they came back to the
elevation within a rod of the spot where they
had left it. Without anything to guide them,
except that strange, unexplainable intuition or
instinct, this was a remarkable exploit in its
way.</p>

<p>But to their alarm, when they peered about
them, after recognizing the place, they failed
to see Herbert.</p>

<p>“Something must have alarmed him,” said
Strubell; “but I hope it was nothing serious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” said Lattin, who
moved hastily back to where the horses had
been placed. He was away but a moment
when he came back.</p>

<p>“The ponies are all there but his; he’s
gone.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">FOR the first time since joining the Texans
in the pursuit of Bell Rickard and his
captive, Herbert Watrous found himself entirely
alone. He was lying on his face in the
grass, at the top of the elevation, peering out
in the night, and watching and listening for
signs of friends and enemies.</p>

<p>It was not until the Texans had been gone
several minutes that he began to fancy his
own situation was threatened with the same
peril that had overtaken Eph Bozeman, the
trapper.</p>

<p>“They were never certain the Apaches
didn’t find out we were here,” he thought,
“and they may have been wrong in thinking
that warrior did not observe us. If those
people are as cunning as I have been told, who
can say that their actions were not meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
throw two such experienced hunters as Strubell
and Lattin off their guard?”</p>

<p>This was figuring matters to a fine point,
and the result was that Herbert reasoned himself
into a most uncomfortable frame of mind
before his friends had been absent a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>“I have half a mind to go out and mount
Jill,” he added, “and move off somewhere
else; I would do it if the chances were not
that I would ride into a worse place than this&mdash;my
gracious!”</p>

<p>He was looking in the direction of the
mission building, when something assumed
form in the darkness immediately in front.
Like the figure that caught the notice of
Lattin at about the same time, the outlines
were so indistinct that he could not identify
it at first, but, with amazement and alarm, he
speedily saw that a horseman had halted at
the foot of the slope, with the face of himself
and steed turned toward him. They were as
motionless as if carved in stone, and their
approach had been accompanied with no sound
that reached the ear of Herbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something so uncanny in the
apparition that, after first identifying it, the
youth suspected it was a mistake, and that
something affected his vision. He turned his
gaze away, and even looked behind him. The
result was similar to that which is noticeable
when we gaze at the Pleiades on a clear night.
Keen scrutiny shows but six stars, one modestly
withdrawing before our ardent gaze, to
reappear when we glance carelessly in the
direction again.</p>

<p>Bringing back his eyes from their groping,
Herbert saw the horseman so plainly that no
room for doubt remained. He was there at the
foot of the slope, apparently staring upward
in the darkness with the same intensity that
the lad was studying him.</p>

<p>There was no room for hoping that this
stranger was a friend, for none of them had
left the spot with his animal. It followed,
therefore, that he was an Apache out for mischief,
since that was the only errand that ever
took those miscreants abroad.</p>

<p>“I believe it is the same one that rode to
the top of the elevation just before night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>”
thought Herbert; “he saw enough to know
something is wrong, and is now seeking to find
out for himself. He mustn’t interfere with
me,” added the youth, compressing his lips, as
he brought his rifle round in front.</p>

<p>Had the Apache made a charge upon him,
Herbert would have let fly without an instant’s
hesitation. He was inclined to fire as
it was; but, like the manly boy that he had
become, he shrank from doing that which
looked so much like a crime. Villainous
as were the red men, he could not force himself
to shoot one down in so heartless a
fashion.</p>

<p>Besides, there was the possibility that the
Indian did not know that anyone was on the
elevation. Indeed, it might be said that the
very appearance as described was evidence
that he lacked such knowledge, for he had
placed himself in a peril which one of his tribe
would be sure to avoid. Herbert therefore
decided to await more positive evidence of
wrong intent before making any movement
against the fellow.</p>

<p>His heart gave a quick throb when he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that the horseman was advancing. He
heard the sound of his pony’s hoofs, followed
by a more distinct outlining of both.</p>

<p>“I do believe I shall have to drop him,”
thought Herbert, “and I wouldn’t wait any
longer if I wasn’t afraid that it would bring
the rest to the spot.”</p>

<p>It was this fear that restrained him. There
were likely to be others near who would swarm
thither at the report of his gun, and more
than likely make him prisoner, or slay him before
he could leap into the saddle and dash off.</p>

<p>Self-interest urged him to wait until the last
moment.</p>

<p>He reasoned that it was impossible for the
sharp-eyed warrior to see him, since he was
still flat in the grass; he must have possessed
wonderful acumen to make his way to the spot
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“It all depends on <i>you</i>,” was Herbert’s decision;
“if you keep your distance no one will
be hurt, but one step more and there will be a
missing Apache.”</p>

<p>The action of the latter was singular,
for, after advancing a brief space, he again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
checked his pony and stood as motionless as
before.</p>

<p>Nothing was clearer than that something
was suspected at least by the red man to cause
him to act in this manner. It may have been
that his pony was the suspicious one, and the
rider was debating with himself whether to
explore further or give it up.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was fortunate for himself
as well as for Herbert that he did not take
long to reach a conclusion. At the moment
the youth believed a meeting was certain, his
steed wheeled and was off like a shot in the
darkness&mdash;gone before Herbert could have
taken any aim.</p>

<p>He drew a sigh of relief at being left alone
once more and so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“I believe that warrior will be back,” was
his conclusion, “and if he is he won’t find
<i>me</i> here.”</p>

<p>Recalling the advice of Strubell, he hurried
to where the horses had been left. They
seemed to have concluded that the coming of
night released them from the command of
their masters to remain on the ground, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
whole four were on their feet, cropping the
grass. Their saddles were in place, but their
bits had been shifted to allow them to eat, and
each one was improving his time.</p>

<p>Jill gave a faint whinny on recognizing his
master, and seemed pleased to feel him in the
saddle again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know which way to go now that
I’m ready,” thought Herbert, “but it won’t
do to ride far, or Strubell and Lattin will have
another young man’s ransom to arrange for.”</p>

<p>Manifestly the counsel of his friends was
meant that he should hold himself ready to
flee the instant it became necessary, but until
then, the chances were even that he would not
decrease his peril by a change of quarters.</p>

<p>A creditable motive led Herbert to adopt
what might be called a compromise, and which
was not lacking in a certain acuteness.</p>

<p>If he remained until detected by the
Apaches, and should then dash off, they were
sure to discover the other horses, and would
shoot or stampede them, leaving the three men
in a hapless plight; but if Herbert were
charged upon at some other point, even if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
far removed, the animals might be overlooked
in the flurry of pursuit.</p>

<p>He therefore rode his pony parallel with the
elevation and in a southern direction, until he
had gone a hundred yards or more, when he
drew up, and awaited the development of
events.</p>

<p>He did not go to the top of the slight ridge,
but near enough to peer over without showing
anything more than the head of himself and
Jill.</p>

<p>All this time he did not forget the risk that
would be run by getting too far from his
friends. If they were to be troubled by trying
to reunite with him, the complication was
likely to affect Nick Ribsam as well. To prevent
himself going astray, he therefore held
along the ridge. That could not fail to be
a sure guide to him whenever he wished to
retrace his steps, for he had only to follow its
course in reverse to reach the former place in
a brief space of time.</p>

<p>His position now was quite similar to that of
the Apache a short while before, for he was
motionless on his steed, facing the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
ridge, and waiting, watching and listening for
whatever might come.</p>

<p>“The whole party of Apaches,” he said to
himself, “may be stealing toward this spot,
thinking to find us all within their reach.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE RETURN.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">HERBERT was quite sure the Texans
would not be gone long, unless they,
too, became involved in a fight with the dusky
raiders and shared in the probable fate of Eph
Bozeman. If such proved to be the case, there
would be sounds of the conflict, which would be
as brief as it was desperate, and it was those
for which he listened while sitting in his
saddle on the slope.</p>

<p>The stillness remaining unbroken, he turned
his pony toward the point he had left, and
found, on reaching it, that Strubell and Lattin
had arrived a few minutes before and were becoming
anxious over his absence.</p>

<p>It was now a question whether the three
should stay where they were or go elsewhere
with their animals. The Apaches were prowling
around the surrounding country so closely
that it looked as if they had located the group.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Such was the view of Strubell and Herbert,
but Lattin, on the other hand, was so positive
that their enemies knew nothing of their presence
that the others agreed to stay where they
were until something more certain became
known.</p>

<p>Trouble was likely to follow a change of
base, since the trapper on his return would be
puzzled to find them, though the Texans would
be sure to give him all the help they could, and
that was considerable.</p>

<p>There was nothing therefore to do but to
wait, the most wearisome occupation of anyone.
The nerves of all were strung to such a
high point that there was little inclination to
sleep. It was a long time since they had eaten
or drank, and they were in need of food and
drink, but no step was to be taken for the procurement
of either until the momentous
question was settled.</p>

<p>Lattin believed that the Indian horseman
seen by Herbert received no inkling of the
truth. His pony had detected something, and
his rider, bringing him to a halt, sat looking
and listening for the explanation that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
come. Concluding it was some wild animal or
reptile moving in the grass, he had dashed off
to join his companions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as both the Texans were in accord
by this time in the theory that they were not
discovered by the red men, at the time of the
scare just before sunset, the youth felt no fear
in that regard. It followed therefore that
the Apaches were unaware of their presence,
and were not likely to learn of it except
through some accident.</p>

<p>No one could forecast the result of the pistol
shot that had rung out over the prairie, and
which showed that the trapper’s stealthy journey
to the building had not been without
incident.</p>

<p>The little company spoke only at intervals,
and then in whispers. Their eyes and ears
were so intently engaged that conversation
interfered. The stillness was so profound that
the champing of the horses was heard as they
cropped the grass, while the sound of the
hoofs was so distinct when they shifted about,
that it seemed to Herbert they must draw the
Apaches to the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by one of the ponies stopped eating
and lay down, then two others did the same,
but the fourth kept it up so long that Lattin
was about to go out and compel him to retire
to his couch, when he did so. This left the
quiet so perfect that it would have taken
a wonderfully skilful warrior to steal up
undetected on foot, and it was impossible for
a horseman to do so.</p>

<p>The stars twinkled from a sky that was
unclouded except in the western horizon,
where a bank of clouds climbed part way to
the zenith and shut out a portion of the faint
light. In whatever direction the watchers
gazed was the same blank darkness. Though
they knew that men were near and constantly
in motion, no glimpse of them was obtained.</p>

<p>“Baker,” said the elder Texan in his
guarded undertone, “I’m going to sleep for
half an hour.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied his companion; “I’ll
do the same when you wake up.”</p>

<p>Strubell made not the slightest change in
his position. He simply turned his head sideways
upon his arm, bent at the elbow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
shut his eyes. Almost at the same moment
he became unconscious.</p>

<p>The party had not removed their blankets
from the backs of the ponies, through fear
that it might delay them whenever a sudden
movement should become necessary. They
were stretched at full length on the grass. In
that salubrious country, with its pure, dry air,
there was no thought of ill results therefrom.</p>

<p>Herbert was near Lattin, and he asked:</p>

<p>“Will he wake at the end of the half
hour?”</p>

<p>“If he don’t I’ll wake him,” replied the
other; “but I never knew Ard to vary more’n
a minute or two.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of Bozeman’s long
absence? Several hours must have gone by.”</p>

<p>“It seems later than it is, but I expected
him back before this.”</p>

<p>“How do you account for his delay?”</p>

<p>“There may be several causes,” replied
Lattin; “in the first place, maybe he run into
a hornets’ nest and was knifed before he
could shoot a second chamber of his revolver.
Them Apaches work quick at such business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and they would shove Eph under in the style
of greased lightning.”</p>

<p>“But,” suggested Herbert, who was after
every grain of comfort, “it might be he found
trouble in getting inside the building.”</p>

<p>“That’s likely, though Ard and me went up
in sight of it without runnin’ agin any of the
varmints; but it couldn’t have kept him all
this time, for if he didn’t get inside long ago
he would have given up and come back to us.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there has been any trouble
with Rickard?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what trouble there could be;
all the work Eph had was to find out the best
the scamp would do, and then either agree or
disagree with him. The most likely trouble is
that Eph found the varmints so plentiful
when he started to come back that he hasn’t
been able to get through and is waiting for the
chance.”</p>

<p>“If that proves the case, what will be done
in the morning?”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell till the morning comes.
Rickard and Slidham may come out to help us
fight our way in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The incident was not impossible, but what
a unique state of affairs it suggested! It recalled
the affairs in the Southwest, during the
Mexican War, when a party of Comanches and
“Greasers” would assail a handful of Americans,
working as the most ardent allies until
the Americans were disposed of, when the
Mexicans and Indians would turn upon each
other like cat o’ mountains.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Lattin a few minutes later,
“there’s the moon.”</p>

<p>The upper edge of the gibbous orb was creeping
above the horizon, and looked like the
point of a fiery spear as it climbed rapidly
upward.</p>

<p>“That’s going to give us help,” said Herbert,
watching the satellite, whose ascent was
strikingly swift.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” replied the
Texan; “it will let us see further ‘cross the
prairie, but don’t forget that it’ll do the same
for the varmints. It won’t be so easy for Eph
to get back as it was to go forward, always
providin’ that he <i>did</i> go forward.”</p>

<p>Strubell slumbered as quietly as an infant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
His breathing could not be heard, even in
the perfect stillness which reigned. Herbert
glanced at him more than once, with an odd
fear that perhaps he was dead, but that was
hardly possible.</p>

<p>Knowing the direction of the building,
Lattin and Herbert tried to peer through the
gloom and see it, but the light was insufficient
to show its most shadowy outlines.</p>

<p>“Baker,” whispered the youth, “I think I
see something out there toward the building.”</p>

<p>“Whether you do or not,” replied the
Texan, “I’m sure <i>I</i> do; someone is comin’
this way.”</p>

<p>“It must be an Apache.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet; we’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>As the hunter spoke, he made sure his rifle
was ready to fire the instant it should become
necessary. He was not troubled by the tender
conscience of his companion in that respect.</p>

<p>The approaching figure was on foot, and,
though advancing without noise, did so swiftly.
It rapidly grew more distinct in the gloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
until the broad-brimmed hat, the massive
frame, with the long rifle grasped in one hand,
left no doubt of its identity.</p>

<p>It was old Eph Bozeman returning at
last.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ENCOUNTER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap07">SUFFICIENT has been told to show that
Eph Bozeman’s stealthy approach to the
mission building was attended by one stirring
incident, if not more.</p>

<p>Leaving his comrades on the crest of the
elevation, he strode forward at a rapid pace,
until he had passed most of the intervening
distance. Then he slackened his gait and
crouched low, his body bent, until he resembled
a person gathering himself for a powerful leap.
This was his favorite posture when engaged
upon such dangerous business, and he kept it
until prudence told him there was too great a
risk attending it.</p>

<p>His object was to defer creeping to the last
moment, since his progress must become
slower, but he was too much of a veteran to
allow the question of convenience to detract
from his vigilance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>At the point he had fixed in his mind he
sank to the ground, and began using his hands
and knees, not the most agreeable form of
locomotion, since, as will be remembered, he
carried his heavy rifle with him.</p>

<p>As yet he had seen and heard nothing of
the Apaches, but believed a brush with them
was inevitable before he could enter the building.
He reasoned that since they knew of the
presence of the white men inside, and were
unaware of the others outside, they would
devote themselves to circling about the structure,
and maintaining a sharp lookout that
none of the occupants got away during the
night. The prospect of adding two or three
more victims to the long list of massacres they
had committed in the Southwest was too
tempting to be passed by, until all prospect of
success was gone.</p>

<p>The trapper’s belief was that the warriors
would remain mounted, though he was too
experienced to guide his own movements upon
that theory alone.</p>

<p>So long as he kept his position close to the
earth, he could discover the approach of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
horseman before the latter saw him, to say
nothing of the slight noise of the pony’s hoofs,
which was sure to betray him.</p>

<p>Twice he caught the latter sound, and
ceasing his progress lay flat, listening and
peering around in the gloom; but the riders
did not come nigh enough for him to discern
them; and after a brief wait he resumed his
slow and laborious progress.</p>

<p>From what had taken place, he was absolutely
certain that the Apaches had no suspicion
that any whites were near the building.
It followed therefore that no precaution
had been taken against his approach, but
they were vigilant enough to demand all the
subtlety he possessed.</p>

<p>He was creeping forward in his guarded
manner when, without the least warning, he
saw the outlines of a figure in front, which,
although dimly observed, he knew was one of
the Apaches.</p>

<p>The trapper sank down again, with his keen
eyes fixed on the warrior, who was standing
with his back toward him, apparently studying
the ground in the direction of the building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which was too far off to be seen, since Eph
himself could not catch the most shadowy
outlines of it.</p>

<p>Since the Apache had not observed the
white man, there was no cause why he should
do so, unless accident should lead him to face
about. Without waiting a moment Eph
began retreating, keeping his gaze on the redskin,
who faded almost from view in the
gloom.</p>

<p>Then the trapper turned to the right and
resumed his advance toward the building.
Time was too valuable to wait for the Indian
to shift his position, which, as likely as not,
would prove unfavorable.</p>

<p>The flank movement was so regulated that
he kept his enemy dimly in sight, for he did
not mean to be surprised by any sudden action
on his part.</p>

<p>All this was well enough, but the Apache
overthrew the whole scheme by an unexpected
movement.</p>

<p>The trapper was on his right, and a couple
of rods distant, when the warrior seemed to
conclude that it was time for him to do something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
He stepped off at his usual pace,
which would have carried him speedily beyond
sight had Eph been somewhere else, but unfortunately
he moved straight toward the old
hunter.</p>

<p>To retreat or advance would have been certain
betrayal, and Eph did not attempt it.
Instead, he silently drew his pistol and grasped
it, ready for firing.</p>

<p>The Apache had no thought of anything of
this kind, but he had taken less than three
paces, when he discovered the figure on the
earth in front of him. He uttered no outcry,
but stopped and placed his hand at his waist,
as if to draw a weapon therefrom. He, too,
carried a gun, most likely a Winchester, and
was expert in its use. He had no blanket, his
body being bare above the waist, and his long,
coarse hair dangled about his shoulders. He
was much shorter and smaller in every way
than the white man, but every ounce of his
body was like that of a tiger.</p>

<p>The Indian might have brought instant help
by a signal, but to do that would have been a
confession that he was afraid to attack a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
individual, and the warrior “wasn’t that sort
of a fellow.”</p>

<p>His pause was only momentary. He stooped
down like an animal about to leap across a
chasm and the trapper caught a movement of
his right hand, which convinced him the warrior
had drawn a knife and meant to spring
upon him.</p>

<p>Eph’s revolver was leveled at the savage,
who was still stealing forward when a single
chamber was discharged. The shot was unerring,
and (what was singular in the case of an
American Indian) he sank downward without
any outcry.</p>

<p>The trapper needed no one to tell him what
next to do. He knew the report of his weapon
would bring nearly if not all the other
Apaches to the spot, and he could not get
away too soon. Springing to his feet, he
loped swiftly toward the building, never
pausing until he stood in front of the broad
door.</p>

<p>He glanced keenly to the right and left
while making this run, but though he heard
the sounds of hoofs, he saw none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
raiders eager for the chance to cut him
down.</p>

<p>Within a half minute after the shot was
fired an Apache reached the spot on his
pony, and was quickly joined by five others,
all mounted. The prostrate figure told the
story, but the author of their comrade’s death
was gone.</p>

<p>While one of them lifted the inanimate
figure upon his steed, the others separated to
find the white man who had slain him. They
did this with rare skill, but they were misled
from the start. Knowing nothing of those
outside the building, their supposition must
have been that one of them had stolen out of
the structure and gained this point before discovery.
It was not to be supposed that he
was striving to enter instead of leave the
place, and they therefore widened the circle,
when they should have contracted it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE shot which the trapper fired in self-defence,
therefore, was of the utmost help
in his approach to the old mission building,
for it broke the line of circumvallation, which
otherwise would have been impassable to anyone
seeking to enter or leave the structure.</p>

<p>To this also was due the escape of Strubell
and Lattin when they hastened to the spot.
It may be said that the entire plan of the
Apaches was disarranged. In trying to cover
so extensive a circle, they left of necessity
vast gaps, through which the Texans passed
without detection. It must have been one of
the Apaches engaged in this curious hunt that
approached Herbert Watrous, as he lay on the
summit of the elevation awaiting the return of
his friends.</p>

<p>The trapper did the best thing possible, for
he had taken but a few steps when the outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of the old mission house assumed form in
the gloom, and he did not halt until he was at
the door.</p>

<p>Despite the stirring incident through which
he had just passed, none of them tried his
nerve as did this last phase of his experience.
He could not know how long he would be kept
waiting; the Apaches were sure to appear
shortly. If forced to stay for a brief period
where he was, he must be discovered, and the
position of a single man at bay in front of
a building, without the liberty to enter, and
obliged to meet the attack of a dozen enemies,
need not be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>Eph gave the heavy door several violent
kicks the moment it was within reach, and
the sound could not only have been heard
throughout the interior, but a long way beyond.
The Apaches were sure to make a
speedy investigation.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the trapper he was not kept
long in suspense. Bell Rickard could not fail
to hear the energetic summons, and quickly
called from one of the upper windows, taking
care not to expose himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Me, Eph Bozeman.”</p>

<p>“Where the mischief did <i>you</i> come from?”
asked the criminal, now venturing to thrust
his head from the window.</p>

<p>“Never mind whar I come from,” replied
the impatient applicant; “come down an’ let
me in powerful quick or you won’t git the
chance to let me in at all.”</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>It seemed a long while before Rickard
descended to the door, during every second of
which Eph expected the Apaches. He stood
ready to let fly with rifle and revolver at the
first sight, but, while waiting, he heard Rickard
at the door, which was speedily unbarred,
and he stepped inside more quickly than
he had ever done anything of the kind
before.</p>

<p>All was dark, but Rickard did not speak
until he had refastened the door, which was
composed of a species of carved wood, still
seen in the old mission houses of the Southwest,
which is hardly less strong and endurable
than the adobe walls themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The trapper was so familiar with the interior
of the structure that he walked readily along
the broad, open hallway, into the court beyond,
where there was sufficient light to observe the
figure of his companion as he led the way to a
small apartment opening into the court, and
within which a dim light was burning.</p>

<p>Into this the two passed, on the first floor,
where Eph found himself face to face with
Bell Rickard and Harman Slidham, whom he
had met a short time before, and knew to be
among the most lawless characters in the
States and Territories.</p>

<p>“I was up in front of the building,” said
Rickard, “looking out for the Apaches when
I heard you at the door.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the trapper, “I tried to
make you hear me.”</p>

<p>The room which the three entered was one
of a dozen similar ones, opening upon the
court in the centre, the building forming what
might be described as a hollow square. Many
years before the apartment had probably been
used as sleeping quarters by the fathers, who
devoted their lives to labor among the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
who, it must be confessed, rarely showed any
appreciation of their self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>It was twenty feet deep, and perhaps half
as broad, without furniture, but with walls
several feet in thickness. The only openings
were the door and two narrow windows facing
the court. These let in sufficient light to give
all the illumination required during the daytime.</p>

<p>In the rear of this room Rickard kept his
supply of meal and dried meat for such contingencies
as the one that now seemed upon
him. The door, of the same material as the
main one, could be secured so that a forced
entrance required great labor and effort, while
the windows were too strait to allow the
smallest person to squeeze his body through.</p>

<p>From an iron bracket in the wall burned an
oil lamp which lit up the interior, showing the
sacks of grain and a couple of boxes containing
dried meat. The sacks and boxes
furnished seats for the men during their
conference.</p>

<p>The trapper glanced searchingly around,
and was surprised to see nothing of Nick Ribsam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
though he made no reference to it; but
knowing of the supply of water, he asked for
a draught before opening proceedings.</p>

<p>An earthen vessel contained a gallon or so,
which Slidham had brought only a short time
before from the spring near by. Eph quaffed
long and deep before setting it on the rough
floor, and drew the back of his hand across his
mouth, with a sigh of enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You can’t improve much on that,” he remarked,
resuming his seat on one of the bags
of grain.</p>

<p>“No; it goes pretty well when you have
been without anything for two or three days,”
replied Rickard, who suspected the errand
that had brought his old acquaintance thither.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as bad as that, but we haven’t had
a swaller sence crossing the Pecos to-day.”</p>

<p>“You say ‘we’; how is that, Eph? When
we parted you were travelling the other way,
and no one was with you.”</p>

<p>“You’re right on that, but I met Ard Strubell
and Baker Lattin, who had a younker with
‘em, and they war after you.”</p>

<p>“After <i>me</i>! What was that for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, Bell, none of that; you understand
what it means; you’ve got a younker, and they
want him.”</p>

<p>“Are they willing to pay for him?” asked
the horse thief.</p>

<p>“Wal, if you’re mean ‘nough to ask it,
they’re ready to give something, but, Bell, I
hardly expected this of you; I knowed you
war dealin’ in hoss-flesh, but I didn’t know
you war goin’ to start in this line of bus’ness.”</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman was a man who spoke his
mind under all circumstances, and he felt not
the slightest fear of the couple, who had followed
a life of outlawry for many years.</p>

<p>Slidham lit his pipe and listened. Rickard
was the leader, and he was content to let him
do the talking for the two. The evil fellow did
not beat about the bush.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference to me what
you expected or didn’t expect; you wouldn’t
have come here at this time unless it was on
business, and if you’ve got anything to say to
me there’s no use in waiting.”</p>

<p>“I guess mebbe your right, Bell; of course
Ard and Baker know what you run off with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
younker for; you mean to keep him till you
get a reward for givin’ him up.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it the first time,” replied
Rickard.</p>

<p>“Wal, the boys talked it over, and they
didn’t like it much, but the younker with
them says he’s willin’ to give somethin’,
but nothin’ very big. How much do you
want?”</p>

<p>“What are they willing to pay?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the way to hit it, Bell, name
what you want, and if it’s too big why I’ll
go back and tell ‘em so, and they won’t give
it, that’s all, but wait for a chance to even
matters with you.”</p>

<p>“What would they say to five thousand?”
asked Rickard in a hesitating way which
gave the cue to the trapper. He rose abruptly
from where he sat on the sack of meal.</p>

<p>“Let me out the gate.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the surprised criminal.</p>

<p>“When you talk that way, thar’s no need
of my waitin’.”</p>

<p>“I asked you to name a sum, but you
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t s’pose you war goin’ to ask all the
money thar is in New York,” said the trapper,
whose ideas of the financial resources of the
great metropolis were crude.</p>

<p>“Well, make a proposal and I’ll tell you
what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Baker thought five hundred was plenty,
but Ard said if you stuck out I might go
a thousand.”</p>

<p>“It’s the other young man that pays it,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“What does <i>he</i> say?”</p>

<p>“Not much of anything,” replied Eph, who
saw the advantage he possessed and did not
mean to let go of it.</p>

<p>“How is he going to pay the money? Has
he got it with him?”</p>

<p>“Of course not; but he explained that he
would give you a draft&mdash;I b’lieve they call it&mdash;that
is, a piece of paper with writin’ on it, which
you can hand over to Mr. Lord in Santone,
and he’ll pay you a thousand dollars&mdash;which
shows what a fool Mr. Lord is, for how can a
piece of paper be worth anything like <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re asking me to trust them a good
way,” said Rickard, who had hoped that the
parties would be able to produce the funds,
“for they may get word to the banker and he
won’t pay it. Then I’ll be out with no way to
help myself.”</p>

<p>“As I figger it,” said the trapper, wrinkling
his brow with thought, and anxious to display
his knowledge, “thar aint no way of fixin’ it
without takin’ a risk like that. You’ve
knowed me and Ard Strubell and Baker Lattin
for a good many years, and you know that
when we give our promise we’ll stick to it.
Aint that so?”</p>

<p>“I don’t dispute it.”</p>

<p>“Wal, then, we three, includin’ likewise
the younker as is to pay the money, give you
our promise that if you’ll send this one with
you back to them, with his hoss, gun, an’
everything right, they’ll give you that paper,
which will bring you one thousand dollars the
minute you hand it to Mr. Lord in Santone.”</p>

<p>“That seems to be straight, though I ought
to have more.”</p>

<p>“I forgot to say that the younker said if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
you should ask a big sum he couldn’t save
trouble in your gettin’ it, which means, I s’pose,
that he’ll have to work it through New York,
or somethin’ like that, but thar won’t be any
trouble ‘bout five hundred or a thousand
dollars.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE DISCOVERY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">BELDEN RICKARD understood business
customs much better than the simple-hearted
trapper, though it will be admitted
that the latter managed his part with cleverness.
He had expected to agree upon a
ransom of five thousand dollars at the least,
and it has been shown that Herbert Watrous
was willing, under stress, to advance double
that sum for the release of his friend; but the
amount was fixed at one thousand, which is
far below the usual rates.</p>

<p>Rickard understood what Eph meant when
he spoke of the trouble about arranging for
the payment of a greater amount. Young
Watrous had a credit to the extent named
with Banker Lord of San Antonio, and to
secure more he would have to consult with
his parents in New York.</p>

<p>This meant delay, which he was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
above everything to avoid, since it involved
personal danger to him. As it was, he dreaded
presenting himself to so well-known a resident
as the banker, but was thinking of turning
over the draft to some trustworthy friend
when Eph, recalling what Herbert had told
him to say, added that the young man would
give him a letter to Mr. Lord that would prevent
the very trouble he feared.</p>

<p>This closed negotiations. Rickard accepted
the terms and did a neat piece of diplomacy
by saying:</p>

<p>“No matter how this is fixed I’ve got to
trust you folks, so I will do it clear through;
I’ll send the boy back with you, and you can
tell your friends to arrange it with the banker
so that I’ll get the money whenever I call
or send someone, and no questions will be
asked.”</p>

<p>“I’ll guarantee that that’ll be done,” was
the emphatic pledge of the trapper, who not
only meant every word, but knew there would
be no withdrawal or deception on the part of
his friends.</p>

<p>“But,” added Rickard, who, strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
enough, had overlooked one momentous fact,
“what about the Apaches? Old Kimmaho
and his gang are out there, and there’s no saying
when they’ll go.”</p>

<p>This was the most serious phase of the business.
Old Eph had been speculating over it
from the moment he left his companions on
the elevation.</p>

<p>Now that the terms were agreed upon with
the captors of Nick Ribsam, and they were
ready to turn him over to his friends, how was
he to be escorted back to them?</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have trouble in getting here?”
asked the criminal of the trapper.</p>

<p>“I had a little brush, and dropped one of
the varmints.”</p>

<p>“That, then, was your pistol that I heard?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder, bein’ as I fired off
a pistol while tryin’ to make a call on you.”</p>

<p>“If you had such trouble in slipping by the
Apaches, you are sure to have a good deal
more when the boy is with you. You know
old Kimmaho, Eph?”</p>

<p>“I rather think so; he’s as bad as
Geronimo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then when he has learned of what took
place, he and his warriors will be more watchful
than before.”</p>

<p>“Thar can be no doubt of that,” replied the
trapper, with an impressive nod of his head;
“I wouldn’t be afeard to try it alone if thar
war twice as many, but I won’t be able to
manage it with the younker.”</p>

<p>“What shall be done?”</p>

<p>“You may shoot me if I know; I’ve been
figgerin’ over the bus’ness for the last hour
and can’t make nothin’ of it.”</p>

<p>But Rickard had a proposition to make. It
was a singular one, but he was in earnest and
would have kept his part as faithfully as he
knew the other parties would keep their
pledge.</p>

<p>“You can get back to Strubell and Lattin if
you try it alone; do that, and then all of you
come in here with me. I will be on the lookout
so that you can dash right through the
door as soon as you reach it.”</p>

<p>The curious feature about this proposition is
that while it was the most feasible that could
be thought of, it displayed a certain chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
on the part of the horse thieves, which would
have struck anyone as inconsistent with the
character of the one making it.</p>

<p>“It’s the idea,” said old Eph, after thinking
it over for a few seconds; “now, if you’ll
fetch the younker so that I can have a few
words with him, I’ll be ready to start back;
I’d like to be able to tell his friends that I seen
him again and spoke to him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Rickard, turning to Slidham
and saying something in so low a tone
that the sharp-eared trapper could not catch
the words. The fellow, who had simply held
his peace, smoked and listened, nodded his
head, rose, and passed through the open door
into the courtyard. Eph heard his footsteps
on the adobe pavement, which had been trod
and seasoned during the past century into a
hardness like that of the walls themselves.</p>

<p>When the sounds died out the trapper threw
a ponderous leg over the other, puffed at his
pipe, and, looking across in the face of one of
the most famous horse thieves in Western
Texas, asked in his off-hand fashion:</p>

<p>“How’s business, Bell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mighty bad,” was the reply, accompanied
by a shake of the head.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“There are too many at it, and the officers
are after us too sharp. You remember Zip
Cooley?”</p>

<p>“I’ve knowed Zip for twenty years, but
have lost track of him for the past two or three
seasons. How is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s at rest at last,” replied Rickard, with
another sigh. “The vigilantes down in Nacogdoches
country got the drop on him&mdash;used him
mighty mean&mdash;made him dance on nothing,
with his chin among the limbs of a tree. Poor
Zip was one of the best men I ever had, but
he’s crossed the big divide.”</p>

<p>“That was bad for Zip,” said Eph grimly,
“but I don’t reckon the folks down in Nacogdoches
will rear a monument reachin’ to the
clouds to keep his mem’ry green.”</p>

<p>“Then,” added Rickard, “Waxhurst and
Doffgo wanted to branch out, so they crossed
over into Arkansas, made a good haul, and
started through the Indian Nation.”</p>

<p>“How did they make out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they ‘branched out’ the same as
poor Zip; you see, our gang has been cut
down pretty low, and when the rangers
gather one in, there isn’t enough at hand to
rally, shoot the officers, and rescue him.”</p>

<p>“What a blamed pity,” growled the trapper,
leisurely puffing his pipe, “that thar warn’t
enough of you just to clean things out atween
El Paso and Santone.”</p>

<p>“No; I wouldn’t want it as good as that;
but we ought to have enough to make it interesting,
and give a fellow a chance to make an
honest living. I had a pretty close call myself
a couple of months ago.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“It was over in the Panhandle; Slidham
and me were alone, and they run us hot, but
we tumbled the leader out of his saddle, hit
the man next to him, and before they could
get things in shape, slipped off in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Slidham a long time bringin’ that
younker?” asked Eph, looking impatiently
at the door.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;ah, here he is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>The man appeared at that moment, his face
showing that he was agitated over something.
He gave Rickard an anxious look, and, without
speaking, nodded his head in a way which
signified something important.</p>

<p>“Eph, you’ll excuse me for a few minutes,”
said the leader, hastily rising to his feet and
moving to the door; “I won’t keep you waiting
long.”</p>

<p>The couple passed out together and the
trapper found himself for the first time
entirely alone. He cared nothing for that,
however, but continued slowly puffing his
pipe, and wondering what the action of the
others could mean.</p>

<p>Several times he heard them moving about
the court, and when he was on the point of
going to them, with a demand for an explanation,
Rickard returned, hastily stepped within
the apartment, and without sitting down
looked earnestly at his visitor.</p>

<p>“Eph,” said he, “don’t you believe I’m
playing square with you?”</p>

<p>“What put that ar silly question in your
head? Of course I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“We agreed on the terms, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we done.”</p>

<p>“Well, the deal is off.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by such stuff?”
demanded the trapper, unable to repress his
astonishment. “Aint you satisfied with the
tarms?”</p>

<p>“Of course, but I can’t carry out my part;
I can’t deliver the goods.”</p>

<p>“WHAT!”</p>

<p>“Nick Ribsam isn’t in the building; he has
escaped!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THROUGH THE LINES AGAIN.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE could be no doubt of the truth of
the startling declaration of Bell Rickard.
He had no object in deceiving the trapper, for
his failure to produce Nick Ribsam deprived
him of the liberal ransom agreed upon by the
representative of Herbert Watrous.</p>

<p>He stated that he had told his prisoner of
the plan he had in view, so that the youth
might be relieved of all dread of violence or
harm, and could be content to abandon whatever
plans he had in mind of escape. He
assured him that, even if he succeeded in getting
away, he would be in greater danger than
ever, since the chances were against his finding
his friends, while the Apaches were quite
sure to find him.</p>

<p>Nick seemed to be impressed with this view,
and Rickard and Slidham concluded that he
meant to wait patiently for his release by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
method explained to him. It now looked as if
Nick had succeeded in outwitting his captors,
after all, and that his apparent resignation
was meant to deceive them into relaxing their
watchfulness.</p>

<p>Although the two men and boy were observed
by Kimmaho and his warriors as they
rode up to the adobe structure, they were able
to enter and secure the massive door before
the Apaches could interfere. Rickard assured
Nick that it was a fortunate thing for
them, since they would have been badly
caught but for the refuge, where they could
laugh at the enmity of ten times that number
of warriors.</p>

<p>If the criminal had felt any misgivings as to
the intentions of Nick, they were removed by
this time; for, after having refused all the
chances offered him, who would suppose that
he would place himself in the most imminent
peril possible from the Apaches, when he had
no knowledge that his friends were within a
hundred miles?</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was gone. When Rickard
found the trapper at the door, he asked Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to remain in another part of the building until
the interview was over. It struck him that it
was better that he should not listen to the
negotiations, though he was willing to bring
him forward when asked to do so.</p>

<p>The criminal indicated no particular one of
the dozen apartments opening on the courtyard,
several of which were intended for the
use of horses. The front of the building consisted
of two stories, with four large rooms,
but the other portion was only a single story
in height.</p>

<p>When Eph asked for a few words with the
boy, Rickard sent Slidham out to bring him
in. The man expected to find him at once,
but as he moved from one apartment to
another, calling to him in a suppressed voice
and hearing nothing in reply, he began to fear
something was amiss. However, he completed
the circuit, including the four large apartments
in front and the room where they had
placed their ponies.</p>

<p>Since he carried no light, it was easy for the
youth to keep out of sight; but Slidham
could think of no reason for his doing this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and he returned to his chief with the word
that he believed the prisoner had “vamosed
the ranch.” Deeming it incredible, Rickard
set out to make the search thorough. He carried
no light, but was fully supplied with
matches, and he burned several in each apartment,
until he had scrutinized the entire
interior, and made sure the youth had not
fallen asleep or was hiding.</p>

<p>It so happened that the stables were the last
place visited. Rickard was holding the tiny
match above his head, anxiously awaiting the
moment when its light should reveal the whole
interior, when Slidham touched his arm, and,
pointing at the ponies, whispered:</p>

<p>“There’s only <i>two</i> of them!”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” replied the leader; “it’s
his horse too that is gone.”</p>

<p>It was true: the faithful Jack that had
stood by his master so long was not in sight.
All doubt was removed, and Rickard hastened
to where he had left Eph Bozeman and told
the astounding news.</p>

<p>The criminal proved his earnestness by
asking the trapper to help him in repeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the search, and he did so, visiting every room
in the building, but without gaining sight of
the missing youth.</p>

<p>“Great guns!” exclaimed Eph, “how did
we come to forgit it?”</p>

<p>He started on a run for the main door. The
others were at his heels, for they knew what
the action meant. If Nick had stolen out and
galloped off, he must have left the entrance
open for anyone to enter. The instant the
Apaches discovered it they would swarm
through, for, as has been shown, the presence
of the few white men within rendered them
furiously eager to enter when otherwise they
would have cared not at all.</p>

<p>Even such a veteran as Eph Bozeman shuddered
on reaching the heavy doors to find them
unfastened, so that a small child could have
passed through from the outside with no
trouble.</p>

<p>“If the varmints had only knowed that!”
he said, after helping to secure it again.</p>

<p>This of course changed all the conditions
and brought the men in front of a new and
alarming problem. Since they were assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that Nick Ribsam, in spite of the danger
from the Apaches, had ridden out of the
front of the building, and his present whereabouts
were unknown, beyond the simple
fact that he was not present, Eph Bozeman
felt that he could not get back to his
friends too soon with the news, and decide
upon an immediate line of action to help the
rash youth.</p>

<p>Rickard renewed his proposal that the
others should dash into the building and stay
there until all danger passed. The Apaches
would be certain to discover them in the morning
if not before, and the three hunters and
single youth could not maintain themselves
against Kimmaho and his band.</p>

<p>This offer would have been accepted without
hesitation, but for the desertion it forced of
Nick Ribsam. The entire course of his friends
for days past was with the single view of helping
him, and it would not do to leave him now
when his peril had been increased a hundredfold.</p>

<p>But admitting all this, the question rose, as
to what possible way there was of aiding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
young man, who had done that which Eph
Bozeman could not understand, after hearing
so much of his brightness.</p>

<p>Indeed, he more than half suspected that
he had already fallen into the hands of the
Apaches. His own passing of their lines was
of the most difficult nature, as the reader has
learned, and it looked impossible for it to be
done a second time, and by one who knew so
little of those subtle red men.</p>

<p>The fact that Nick was mounted ought to
have been of great help in the event of discovery,
for his pony was as fleet as the fleetest of
the Apache steeds, but those ferocious raiders
would find little trouble in entrapping the
boldest white man who ventured within sight
of them on so dark a night.</p>

<p>Be the conclusion what it may, the necessity
of the trapper returning to the Texans was
obvious. He told Rickard that he would try it
at once, and no decision could be reached until
after a talk with them.</p>

<p>“If we agree to make a break for these
quarters, it’ll be just as it is growin’ light,”
said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll be on the lookout,” replied Rickard,
“and you can feel certain there won’t be any
trouble in gettin’ in.”</p>

<p>With this understanding a careful survey
was taken of the ground immediately in front,
and, nothing being seen of the Apaches, the
visitor stepped outside. He had spent several
hours within the building, and knew his
friends were wondering at his long absence,
but he now did a thing for which there seemed
no justification.</p>

<p>Fairly without the door, he moved aside a
few paces, as if to leave, but instead of doing
so, stood motionless, with his back against the
outer wall. He was listening for something
besides Apache warriors, and by and by he
heard it; it was the noise made by Bell
Rickard in refastening the heavy doors.
He had waited until he believed his caller
was gone too far to return, when he secured
himself and companion against the common
enemy.</p>

<p>The moment the door was locked Eph
stepped noiselessly forward and stooped down.
It was too dark for him to see distinctly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
but he could feel as well as ever, and he
passed his hands back and forth over the
earth, as if he had lost a valuable coin and
was searching for it through the sense of
touch alone.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DECISION.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE situation of the trapper was perilous
in the extreme, for it was to be supposed
that the Apaches, after the loss of one of their
number, would maintain unremitting watch of
the only avenue through which anyone could
enter or leave the building; but he remained
in a stooping posture for several minutes, passing
his hands back and forth over the ground,
until he had several times covered the space in
front of the door.</p>

<p>Finally, with a muttered exclamation, he
stood erect, and was ready to start toward his
friends, a long way off on the elevation where
he had left them hours before.</p>

<p>His keen ear, trained to wonderful fineness
by his years of life in the wilderness, caught
the footfalls of a horse, which he knew at once
was ridden by one of the Apaches. Instead
of moving off, or attempting to re-enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
building, he remained upright, with his back
against the structure. Had there been a corresponding
figure on the other side of the
door, a person observing the two from a brief
distance would have declared they had been
carved and set there scores of years before.</p>

<p>The Indian rode up within sight, and halted
a moment while he gazed at the front of the
structure. Nothing was easier than for the
trapper to tumble him from his pony, but he
was too wise to summon the band by doing so.
He gazed at him in turn, content to let him
alone as long as he did not disturb him.</p>

<p>The Apache must have felt that he was in
danger of drawing a shot from one of the
upper windows, for he quickly wheeled his
steed and rode off in the darkness.</p>

<p>He was hardly out of sight when Eph moved
straight out from the building. If Rickard or
his companion were on the watch they must
have wondered at the sight, though it was
explainable on the ground that the trapper
was waiting a favorable opening to run the
gauntlet.</p>

<p>Instead of crawling, the veteran broke into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
his loping trot, which was speedier than it appeared.
The moon had risen, and though it
was at his back he feared the result of the
exposure to its additional light.</p>

<p>In no way can the success of Eph be explained
other than on the ground that it was
one of those pieces of extremely good fortune
which sometimes attend rash enterprises on the
part of a cool-headed man. He heard the
sound of galloping horses, and twice caught
their shadowy outlines, but he was on the
alert, and, dropping to the earth, waited until
the peril passed. In both cases the red men
came no nearer, and he was soon advanced so
far that he believed the worst was over. He
straightened up once more, and, as I have
shown, strode directly forward to the elevation,
where all three of his friends were awaiting
his coming with an anxiety that cannot be
understood by one not similarly situated.</p>

<p>The little party listened to his story with
breathless interest, Herbert being the first to
speak at its conclusion.</p>

<p>“That’s just like Nick,” he said; “he has
been waiting his chance all these days and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
nights, and when those men had no suspicion
of what he intended, he has given them the
slip.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have much opinion of <i>that</i> younker,”
said the old trapper curtly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The most foolishest thing he could do was
to ride out of that building just as it ‘pears he
has done. If he had stayed thar the whole
thing war fixed, but now whar ar you?”</p>

<p>“If he has fallen into the power of Kimmaho
or any of his party,” said Strubell, “it
will take more than a thousand dollars to get
him back.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they will demand?”
inquired Herbert, his fears aroused
again.</p>

<p>“They won’t ask <i>anything</i>,” said Lattin;
“the Apaches don’t deal in the ransom
bus’ness as much as some other folks.”</p>

<p>“But you talk as though he is a prisoner of
theirs.”</p>

<p>“If he is alive, what else can he be?”</p>

<p>“He was well mounted and might have
escaped on horseback.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that had been the case,” added the
elder Texan, “we couldn’t have helped knowing
it.”</p>

<p>“But there was no noise when Eph met the
Apaches except the report of his pistol.”</p>

<p>“We have been listening so closely here,
except when I was asleep, that we noticed the
tramp of the Apaches’ ponies even when they
were walking; if Nick rode off at full speed
we must have heard the sounds, because they
would have been much louder.”</p>

<p>“Suppose on leaving the building, during
Eph’s interview with the two men, he had
ridden around to the rear and galloped several
miles to the westward, would you have heard
Jack’s hoofs?”</p>

<p>“Thar’s somethin’ in that,” remarked the
trapper; “you’re all pretty sharp-eared, but
that would have been too much for you to
catch.”</p>

<p>“The supposition, however, is a very thin
one,” insisted Strubell, to whom the action of
Nick Ribsam was very annoying.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry he did it,” remarked Herbert,
“but we must take things as they are, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
when we meet him we’ll haul him over the
coals.”</p>

<p>“Did Bell know anything about our being
out here?” asked Strubell, turning to the
trapper.</p>

<p>“He ‘spected you three, but he didn’t know
nothin’ ‘bout <i>me</i>, and didn’t know when you
would show yourselves. He s’posed I would
meet you and give you the news, and you
would hurry along. He knowed you war
aimin’ for the old mission buildin’ and would
be along after a while if the varmints didn’t
cut you off.”</p>

<p>“What about our pack animals?”</p>

<p>“He spoke of ‘em, and said Jim-John and
Brindage would ‘tend to ‘em.”</p>

<p>“You did so well in arranging the ransom
that you ought to have included them.”</p>

<p>“I could have done it if you had said so,
but I follered orders,” replied the trapper.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lattin, “the question now is
what we are to do; if Nick only knowed where
we are it would be simple enough; he could
give the Apaches the slip and hang ‘round till
mornin’, when we could come together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it looks as if he will ride till daylight
as hard as his pony can stand it&mdash;that is, if
the redskins haven’t got him,” observed Strubell,
“and we may hunt over the whole of New
Mexico and Arizona without finding him.”</p>

<p>“It don’t seem to me that it will be as bad
as that,” remarked Herbert, eager to gather
every crumb of comfort; “for he must know
he can’t find us by riding westward, but will
start eastward after escaping the Apaches, so
as to meet us on the way.”</p>

<p>“But that start that you’re talking about,”
reminded Strubell, “has been made hours ago,
if it was made at all, and he must now be far to
the eastward.”</p>

<p>“He will be on the lookout for us and will
strike the trail before going far.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason to believe that; we are not
following any trail at all; if we were there
would be hope, but the chance of his finding
our footprints equals that of picking up a certain
blade of grass on the left bank of the
Brazos, when no one can direct you within a
hundred miles of the spot.”</p>

<p>Herbert was trying to gather hope from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
different views of the situation, but it looked
as if his friends were determined to prevent
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>“If you folks knew Nick Ribsam as well as
I,” he sturdily insisted, “you would have a
higher opinion of him than you seem to
have.”</p>

<p>“Baker and I thought as well of him as
you,” said Strubell, “but we are judging him
now by what he did this evening; if he had
stayed where he ought to have stayed the
whole business would have been over.”</p>

<p>“But the Apaches are still near us,” replied
Herbert.</p>

<p>“We could manage that; Rickard would let
us inside, where we could all be together; Kimmaho
might lay siege to us for days or weeks,
but he couldn’t harm us, and after a time
would grow tired and ride off to more inviting
fields.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” observed Lattin, who
seemed to dislike the general condemnation in
which he had joined of a youth of whom they
had all become fond, “that the most that can
be said about the younker is that he has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the same mistake that one of us was likely to
make. He found what he thought was a good
chance to give the scamps the slip, and he
done it as neatly as anything of the kind was
ever done in this world.”</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman had held his peace for some
time. Strubell now turned to him and asked
his views, adding that they would be followed.</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied decisively; “at the
first streak of daylight to-morrer we make
a break for the old buildin’ yonder.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FINAL CHARGE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">AT THE earliest streaking of gray in the
eastern horizon the three men and Herbert
Watrous, all of whom had been sleeping
fitfully by turns through the long dismal
hours, silently rose to their feet and walked to
where the ponies, a short distance off, had
resumed their cropping of the grass. They
were thirsty, like their masters, but no water
was within reach, and they were doing their
best to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p>The outlines of the old adobe mission building
showed faintly through the obscurity as
the little party headed westward, and advanced
at a moderate walk, on the alert for
the Apaches, of whom they had detected signs
now and then during their wearisome watching.</p>

<p>The action of the red men had puzzled the
trapper as well as Strubell and Lattin. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
hard to understand why they had not stumbled
on the truth, but there was good reason
for believing they were still ignorant of the
presence of the white men so near them. It
was upon this theory that the success of the
daring enterprise was based.</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman placed himself at the head,
Herbert coming next, with one of the Texans
on either side. The veteran was the best qualified
to lead, while the disposition of all was
with a view of protecting the younger and less
experienced member of the party.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of their enemies until half
the distance was passed, when Lattin, who was
on Herbert’s right, exclaimed in an undertone:</p>

<p>“Yonder are the varmints!”</p>

<p>The horses were in excellent condition because
of their long rest, and up to this moment
moved at a moderate trot. As the Texan
spoke, the trapper, who had detected the danger,
struck his animal into a brisk gallop, the
others doing the same without any urging of
their riders.</p>

<p>The Apaches must have relaxed their vigilance
toward the latter part of the night, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
most, if not all the group, were observed to
the south of the structure instead of being
near it. They were closer to it, however, than
the whites, and showed their daring by immediately
riding forward to meet them.</p>

<p>The trapper turned his head and said: “Let
‘em have it the minute they’re near enough to
hit.”</p>

<p>These were words which had meaning, and
Herbert, like his companions, looked at his
Winchester to make sure it was ready for
instant service.</p>

<p>“I think they’re all there,” added Lattin.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” remarked Strubell, “for
there isn’t more than six or eight.”</p>

<p>“And Nick isn’t with them,” Herbert could
not help exclaiming, with a thrill of pleasure.</p>

<p>No reply followed this, which might signify
nothing, for all were too intent on what was
before them.</p>

<p>The interest deepened each moment. The
Apaches, numbering exactly eight, were advancing
at a speed fully as great as that of
the whites, riding close together and apparently
all eagerness for the conflict. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
indulged in no shouts, whoops, or gestures, but
came on like the grim demons they were.</p>

<p>Each carried his gun, and he was not afraid
to use it whenever the chance offered. Nothing
could have looked more frightful than
they, their chests naked, their irregular features
daubed with different colored paint,
their long black hair dangling about their
shoulders, while each rode like a centaur.</p>

<p>A distance of two hundred yards separated
the parties, neither of which had made the
slightest variation in its course. Our friends
were heading directly toward the building
and did not swerve to the right or left.
To have done so would have shown fear, and
brought the redskins down upon them like a
cyclone.</p>

<p>One of two things was inevitable, and
that within the space of a few seconds: the
Apaches or white men must turn to one side,
or there would be a fierce fight. Eph Bozeman
and his comrades were resolved to keep
on until the noses of their ponies should
touch. What was the purpose of the red men
must appear immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>The break came from an unexpected source.
Belden Rickard and Harman Slidham had not
forgotten the parting words of the trapper,
and were on the watch at the upper front
windows. The rapidly increasing light showed
the four horsemen coming down the slope, and
they saw the Apaches set out to meet them.
Matters were on the eve of explosion when
Rickard took deliberate sight from his window
and fired at the warriors. The shot was a long
one, but so accurately aimed that a dusky
horseman, with a rasping screech, rolled off
his pony, the animal breaking into a gallop,
circling away from the others, and, facing
toward the building, whinneying with fright
and dashing aimlessly hither and thither in
a panic.</p>

<p>The other Apaches acted as if the report of
the gun was the signal for them to break apart,
for they did so with a suddenness that could
not have been surpassed had a bombshell burst
beneath them.</p>

<p>Several turned to the right and others to the
left, while one, as if he absolutely feared
nothing, headed his black pony directly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Bozeman and thundered forward on a dead
run.</p>

<p>The miscreant was actually charging the
whole party.</p>

<p>He emitted a terrifying whoop, leaning almost
on his horse’s ears, as he brought his
rifle round in front to fire, but a master hand
at that business had not taken his eye from
him since he started on his daring ride. The
raising of the gun and the aiming and firing
seemed to take place all together, and in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>“Thar’s one fool less,” was the quiet
remark of Eph as he lowered his piece;
“now, boys, grab ground.”</p>

<p>His pony was stretching away at headlong
speed for the building, the others imitating
him so quickly that the four continued in
a bunch. “Keep it up,” he added, firing
again at their assailants.</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin discharged their pieces
as often as they could take any sort of aim,
but the conditions were against accuracy, and
there was no evidence that they did any
execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>The Apaches had branched off to the right
and left, and kept popping away, with no more
success than the white men. They held the
marksmanship of the others in such fear that
they gave much effort to screening their bodies,
by flinging themselves over the sides of their
animals and firing from under the neck or
directly over it, where little could be seen of the
riders except their glaring eyes and their hair,
looking as if they were a part of the mane of
their ponies, or the black eyes flashed for a
moment in front of the breast of the galloping
steeds.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Herbert Watrous felt
pleasant when he heard the bullets singing
about his ears, and knew that more than one
was aimed at him. He did not attempt to
reply, but gave his whole attention to urging
Jill to his utmost. The building was only a
short way off, and the briefest kind of a respite
insured safety.</p>

<p>Fortunately his steed was fully the equal of
the others in fleetness and did not fall behind.
Had it done so he would not have been left by
his friends, for all were governed by that devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
which belongs to the highest form of
chivalry. There was not one who would not
have protected the youth with his life.</p>

<p>Suddenly the broad door at the front of the
adobe building was drawn inward. Rickard
and Slidham had hurried down to make sure
no delay took place at this critical moment.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous was leaning forward, with
his eyes fixed on the avenue to safety, when he
felt Jill shudder under the saddle, as if with a
sudden chill. He veered to one side, throwing
his nose against the shoulder of the trapper’s
pony, and staggered uncertainly in the hopeless
effort to recover himself, but, unable to do
so, plunged forward on his knees and rolled
over on his side, gasping his last breath.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE thrusting of the mortally wounded
pony’s nose against the shoulder of the
trapper’s horse warned both him and Herbert
Watrous of what was coming. The latter
slipped his feet from the stirrups, and was in
the act of leaping to the ground, to attempt to
run the short distance to the entrance of the
mission building, when the broad right hand
of Eph Bozeman slapped him in the broad of
the back, clutched his coat, and with one
powerful wrench he swung him out of the
saddle sinking beneath him, and lifting him
over in front of himself on his own steed.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest slackening of
speed on the part of the doubly laden animal,
who not only held his own, but headed the
procession as it dashed through the door,
followed by the other two, amid a storm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
bullets, as Rickard and Slidham slammed the
door shut and fastened it in place.</p>

<p>The whole party was safe, without a scratch,
and with only the loss of a single animal.</p>

<p>They could hardly believe their good
fortune, until their panting steeds were
brought to a halt and the riders slipped to
the ground.</p>

<p>Then followed a general handshaking, and
it would have been hard to believe that anything
like enmity had existed between the
men who showed such genuine pleasure at the
escape of the little company from the Apaches.
But a common danger draws people together,
and Rickard and Slidham forgot that but
a short time ago they had agreed to return
a youth to these same visitors for a certain
ransom.</p>

<p>The first thing done after a general exchange
of congratulations was on the part of the new
arrivals. They made haste to the spring of
cool, refreshing water, where they quaffed
their fill, their ponies doing the same.</p>

<p>Rickard had made preparations for their
coming. From his storehouse of meal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
meat he had prepared a nourishing and abundant
meal for all. Since there was no grass
within the building, the horses were fed with
the grain, of which there was sufficient to last
several weeks by the exercise of frugality.</p>

<p>The animals having been attended to and
the hunger and thirst of the guests being
satisfied, the company gathered in the small
room where Eph Bozeman had held his interview
of the night before. They crowded the
place, but all found seats, and they conversed
as freely as if they had been friends for years.</p>

<p>“I made a bad break,” said Rickard, with a
laugh; “you’ll admit that I worked that plan
pretty well, but I didn’t count on the boy
giving me the slip at the last minute.”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose he has gone?”
asked Strubell, who did most of the talking
for his side, the others listening attentively to
every word that was spoken.</p>

<p>“He must have been on the watch when
Eph come in; we were all three in this room,
talking the matter over, when he slipped out
with his pony and has gone, who can say
where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if the Apaches had
caught him.”</p>

<p>“No; I thought they might have done so,
but there would have been an outcry if that
took place. We wouldn’t have heard the
sound of his horse as he rode off, but he would
have used his rifle and pistol before allowing
himself to be taken, and we must have heard
them. He was the pluckiest fellow I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” added Herbert; “Nick Ribsam
was a brave boy; he gave me the biggest
trouncing I ever had when he wasn’t more than
half my size, and there’s no Indian that can
down him without having the worst fight of
his life.”</p>

<p>“What I don’t understand,” continued
Strubell, “is why he should wait until everything
was in the best shape for him, and then
slip off and knock our plan endways.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he have any chance of gettin’ away
when you was on the road here?” inquired
Lattin.</p>

<p>“Well, we watched pretty close, for we
knew what he was thinking of; Harman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
I were never asleep at the same time, and we
didn’t let him have his gun or pistol while on
the road.”</p>

<p>Herbert’s heart burned with indignation at
these words, but he kept silent. He knew
now why Nick had remained passive so long.
He was too wise to dash away from his captors
and ride out on the open prairie, exposed to
innumerable dangers, without a weapon at
command. Had he been allowed to retain
them he would have made things lively for
Bell Rickard.</p>

<p>Rickard stated further that they had no
field glass at command, like their pursuers, so
that they never caught sight of them, though
well convinced they were on their trail. Consequently
Nick had not the incentive that
would have been his had he felt any assurance
of meeting his friends if he fled eastward.</p>

<p>“When we arrived here,” continued the
horse thief, “and we knew the Apaches were
close outside, why, we let him have his
weapons, for it looked as if he might be able
to help us against the redskins.”</p>

<p>“Of course when he saw Eph come through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the door and join you in this room,” said
Strubell, “he had no idea that he came from
us; if he had he would have acted differently&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t either; you don’t know
what you’re talkin’ ’bout.”</p>

<p>It was the old trapper who uttered this
exclamation, after he had held his peace for
several minutes. All looked at him wonderingly,
for it was not clear what he meant by
his abrupt remark. His little eyes shone with
a peculiar light, and could his mouth have
been seen, a singular smile would have been
observed playing around it.</p>

<p>“Boys,” added Eph, straightening up on his
seat as he saw every gaze fixed upon him,
“shall I tell you something?”</p>

<p>The expression of general interest convinced
him that no one could be heard with greater
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Last night, after passin’ out the door,
a quar idea got into my head. Instead of
startin’ on a run to get back to you folks,
I stooped down and passed my hands over the
ground all round the door. And what do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
s’pose I found? Why, thar war the prints of
several horses goin’ in, <i>but thar warn’t a
single one comin’ out</i>!”</p>

<p>He paused a moment for this astounding
announcement to produce its effect. Strubell
was the first to catch its full meaning.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“As sure as I’m sittin’ here this minute.
What does it mean, tharfore and consequently?
Why, that that younker came in with Bell and
Harman, but that he <i>haint gone out, which the
same means that he’s inside of this buildin’
and aint fifty feet off this very minute</i>, and if
thar’s anyone here that don’t b’lieve me, all
he’s got to do is to look through that door
yonder and tell me whether he don’t see
the grinnin’ younker standin’ thar this very
minute.”</p>

<p>It so happened that as Eph sat he faced the
opening of the little room, and, since every
eye was fixed on him, their backs were
turned in the other direction. All wheeled
like a flash and saw Nick Ribsam in the
act of entering the apartment, his honest face
expanded into one broad smile, while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
hand was extended to greet his old acquaintances.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous stared with open mouth,
unable to believe it was not a dream, until his
hand was clasped by that of the best friend he
had, outside of his own folks, in the world.
Then he saw that it was reality, and greeted
the good fellow with a delight which touched
even the hearts of Bell Rickard and Harman
Slidham.</p>

<p class="p2">Enough has been hinted about Nick Ribsam
to give the reader a general idea of his experience
from the night he was made prisoner by
the horse thieves and carried westward into
New Mexico. Herbert was correct in his surmise
as to why he made no effort to escape
while on the long journey. With no firearms
at command, with no knowledge of where his
friends were, and believing that his captors
were only manœuvring for a ransom, he would
have disproved all faith in his good sense had
he seized any one of the several occasions for
parting company with those whom he despised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>He had no suspicion of the business which
brought Eph Bozeman to the building, else he
would not have played the little deception he
did on his captors; but when requested to betake
himself to some other part of the structure
during the interview, he obeyed, passing
into the room which adjoined the one where
the ponies had been placed.</p>

<p>Here he struck a match that he might investigate
his surroundings. The first thing that
caught his attention was a door, which he did
not notice until he was at the further end of
the apartment, and then he would not have
observed it had not his gaze struck it in a
peculiar manner.</p>

<p>A brief examination showed that it was
intended by the parties who built the mission
house as a secret storehouse or retreat in a
last emergency. It was so ingeniously constructed
that the space occupied was cut off
from three other apartments, and the missing
portion was not likely to be noticed unless
suspicion happened to be turned that way.</p>

<p>The room was long and narrow, and there
was space at one end for a horse, ventilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
being secured by means of several slits that
were cleverly concealed from view. Of course
it would not have required a close search
for anyone to discover it from the outside, but
that search was not made.</p>

<p>The moment Nick stumbled upon the retreat,
the idea of a trick came to him. He led
Jack into the space, slipped out and unfastened
the door to give the impression that he had
passed through it, and then returned and ensconced
himself within.</p>

<p>The reflection came to him that he had
done an exceedingly risky thing in leaving
the door unfastened, but he reasoned that
he would soon be missed and the open avenue
discovered. Then, too, what band of
Apaches, or white persons for that matter,
would dream of such a piece of negligence
on the part of three persons who knew of
their danger?</p>

<p>While debating the matter with himself,
and when he was on the point of going out to
secure the door again, he fell asleep and did
not open his eyes until after the arrival of his
friends. The reports of the rifles were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
dulled by the intervening walls that they had
not disturbed him at all.</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman was convinced of the presence
of the youth within the building on his failure
to find any hoof prints leading outward from
the door. He deemed it best to say nothing
of this to his companions, since he wanted to
give them a surprise, and he did it beyond
question.</p>

<p>What pleased the old trapper was the
certainty that Bell Rickard, after all, must
lose the thousand dollars, for under the circumstances
he had no legal claim to it, inasmuch
as Nick had escaped from his custody,
and he confessed himself unable to perform
his part of the contract.</p>

<p>Our friends were one horse short, and the
loss was a severe one. It was decided to stay
where they were until the Apaches grew tired
of the siege, and communication could be
opened with other parties. Jim-John and his
companion were supposed to be making their
way toward the same destination with the
pack horses, one of which could be turned to
account in case nothing better presented itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>But at this interesting juncture Bell Rickard,
of all others, solved the difficulty in an
unexpected manner. He insisted that he had
come by his own horse fairly, and he asked the
privilege of furnishing it to Herbert Watrous.
He said he would wait where he was until the
arrival of Jim-John and Brindage, and accept
one of the pack horses in exchange. This was
finally agreed to, and the transaction was probably
the first honest one of the kind in which
the fellow had taken part in a long time.</p>

<p>On the second day all signs of the Apaches
disappeared. They had carried off the bodies
of those who had fallen, and sought more
inviting fields for their cruel work.</p>

<p>Instead of pushing on to California, as Nick
and Herbert originally intended, they decided
to return to San Antonio with Strubell and
Lattin. Herbert had fully recovered his
health, and, to tell the truth, both boys were
homesick. They felt there was no place like
their own homes, and the society of their
loved ones. They had been granted that
which led them across Texas, and why go
further?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the incidents of
their return to the quaint old town of San
Antonio, although the journey was marked by
many interesting incidents. They arrived
there without serious mishap, and, parting
company with the Texans and the old trapper,
who was liberally rewarded for his services,
Nick, just one week later, clasped his father,
mother, and sister Nellie in his arms. Herbert
stayed a day with him, and then hastened
to his home in New York City, where it need
not be said he was welcomed with gratitude
and affection.</p>

<p>And here the history of Nick Ribsam and
Herbert Watrous properly ends. That they
will be the same warm, trustful, loving friends
through life need not be said, and the good
seed sown by the honest young Pennsylvanian
in the heart of his city associate will spring up
and bear a blessed fruit, the full degree of
which can never be known until they enter
upon the life to come.</p>
